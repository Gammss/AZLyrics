"""Dahil Sa'yo""",Inigo Pascual,"""Inigo Pascual""","

Araw araw ikaw ang gusto kong kasama
Buhay ko'y kumpleto na tuwing nandidito ka
Sa tabi ko o aking giliw di pa din ako makapaniwala
Na ang dati kong pangarap ay katotohanan na

Ikaw ang tanging inspirasyon
At basta't nandito ka ako'y liligaya

Dahil sa'yo ako'y matapang
Dahil sa'yo ako'y lalaban
Para sa'yo pagmamahal na walang katapusan
Dahil sa'yo merong pangarap
Pagmamahal ko sayo'y tapat
Para sa'yo pagmamahal na higit pa sa sapat

Gagawin ko ang lahat para lang sa'yo sinta
At basta't nandito ka ako'y liligaya

Minuminuto naghihintay ng tawag mo
Marinig lang boses mo masaya't kuntento na ko
Wala ng iba pang hahanapin basta't ikaw ang aking kapiling
Lahat magagawa dahil kasama ka

Ikaw ang tanging inspirasyon
At basta't nandito ka ako'y liligaya

Dahil sa'yo ako'y matapang
Dahil sa'yo ako'y lalaban
Para sa'yo pagmamahal na walang katapusan
Dahil sa'yo merong pangarap
Pagmamahal ko sayo'y tapat
Para sa'yo pagmamahal na higit pa sa sapat

Gagawin ko ang lahat para lang sa'yo sinta
At basta't nandito ka ako'y liligaya

Ipinagdarasal ko ng sobra na sana'y tanggapin mo aking inaalay
Na pasasalamat sa pagliliwanag ng buhay kong ito
Na dati rati'y di ganito na kay ligaya
Oh tanggapin ang regalo
Oh mga rosas at choco
Liliwanag din ang buhay mo pag nilabas ko na ang puso ko

Ikaw ang tanging inspirasyon
Sa bawat araw na haharapin
Gagawin ko ang lahat para lang sa'yo sinta
At basta't nandito ka ako'y liligayaâ¦

Dahil sa'yo ako'y matapang
Dahil sa'yo ako'y lalaban
Para sa'yo pagmamahal na walang katapusan
Dahil sa'yo merong pangarap
Pagmamahal ko sayo'y tapat
Para sa'yo pagmamahal na higit pa sa sapat

Gagawin ko ang lahat para lang sa'yo sinta
At basta't nandito ka ako'y liligaya

"""Binibini""",Inigo Pascual,"""Inigo Pascual""","

Binibini sa aking pagtulog
Ika'y panaginip ko
Panaganip ng kathang dakila
Nitong pag-iisip ko
Ang katulad mo raw ay birhen
Sa abang altar ng punong pag-ibig
O kay ganda
O kay gandang mag-alay sa 'yo

Alaala, at isip at pagod
Sa yo'y binigay ko raw
Binibini, ang aking dalangi't dasal
Dininig mo raw
Wika mo raw ay iingatan ka
Magpakailanman ang purong pag-ibig
O kay ganda
O kay ganda mag-alay sa 'yo
Hooh...

Sa 'king tanong magkatutoo
Kaya
Sagot mo para nang sinadya
Hooh...

Pagsapit ng magandang umaga
Ako'y bumalikwas din
Panaginip naglaho't natunaw
Nguni't nar'yan ka pa rin
Paraluman, ikaw ay akin
Sa bisang lakas ng purong pag-ibig
O kay ganda
O kay gandang mag-alay sa 'yo
O kay ganda
O kay gandang mag-alay sa 'yo

Eto na naman
Wala ng magawa
Dahil sa nararamdaman
Pilit-pilitin man itago ang laman
Ng puso di ko magawa

Sana naman makita mo
Na Ikaw lang naman ang hanap-hanap ko

Dito ka na lang sa piling ko
'Wag na wag ka nang aalis
Dito ka na lang sa yakap ko
'Wag na wag ka ng bibitiw

Dito ka na lang
Dito ka lang

Naguguluhan kung saan saan naghanap
Pero di makahanap ng katulad mo
Kung sa'kin ka lang di ka sasaktan
Pangako hinding hindi ka iiwan

Sana naman makita mo
Na Ikaw lang naman ang hanap-hanap ko

Dito ka na lang sa piling ko

Dito ka na lang sa yakap ko
'Wag na wag ka ng bibitiw

"""That Hero""",Inigo Pascual,"""Inigo Pascual""","

Waiting for a hero to save you
Waiting for a miracle
Waiting for an angel to come
But nobody's come your way

Waiting for divine intervention
Waiting for some action
Waiting for redemption to come
But nothing has happened

Suspend all your disbelief, no
'Cause what you've been lookin' for
Is here all along

You could be that hero! Hero!
You could be that hero! Hero!
You could be that hero! Hero!
You could be that hero! Hero!
You could be that hero!

You could be tha... oh
You could be tha... no
You could be that, that hero

Lookin' for a better life
Dreamin' of a better you
Hoping for a brighter tomorrow
It now all depends on you
Neither here nor there
Been lookin' everywhere
Can't find it anywhere
It's in you...

You could be that hero!
Flying up in the sky
Invincible from the fire
You could be that hero!
Slaying villains
The mountais will move
At the touch of your hand
You could be that hero!
Saving worlds in a day
Breaking bondages
Come what may
You could be that hero!
Just believe and receive
And His power be vested on you

Just like in a movie scene
You're trapped somewhere in between
A vicious killing machine
You're shouting, ""Somebody save me!""
But life ain't a movie
You gotta get up
Just stand up
'Cause you know
You know the hero is you!
You!
You know, you know
But you wish, you...

You could be that hero!
Flying up in the sky
Invincible from the fire
You could be that hero!
Slaying villains
The mountais will move
At the touch of your hand
You could be that hero!
Saving worlds in a day
Breaking bondages
Come what may
You could be that hero!
Just believe and receive
And His power be vested on you
You could be that hero!

Neither here nor there
Been lookin' everywhere
Can't find it anywhere
It's in you, you, you...

Neither here nor there
Been lookin' everywhere
Can't find it anywhere

Hmmm hmmm, ohh ohh

I never thought someone like you, would ever come along
The big question was where, where did I belong
Now I'm sitting next to you, singing you this song
Please notice me, cause I've been here all day long

I never really knew what I wanted or needed
You came and all the fear and sadness ended
I thought to myself, maybe it's right
Or maybe it's wrong, but I hope you like me too
Cause I think I just realised
I have fallen for youuuu, woah
Fallen for youuuu

Your laugh, your smile and the way you cringe your nose
When you try to lie but you can't cause it really shows
The funny little things that you do that makes me crazy
I'll try to show you, cause I really want you to see it

I never really knew what I wanted or needed
You came and all the fear and sadness ended
I thought to myself, maybe it's right
Or maybe it's wrong, but I hope you like me too

No matter how far
No matter how long

Go well, you gotta live life brighter
Go well

Today is a new day, you gotta find your way
Discover possibilities
Now you do it your own way
You gotta find your own way up
There's no other way but up
Stack the deck, 'cause you gotta live life
You gotta live life

And I am thankful for the love
Another day has begun
I'm captivated
If you live another day, another chance
And in a glance
You'll know you gotta live brighter

Everything is good under the sun
Go well, you gotta live life brighter
Go well, you gotta live life brighter

Be good to your body, be good to yourself
Run outside today, don't forget to play
On your way up, there's no other way but up
Exercise your right to life
You gotta live life

Forever thankful for the love
Another day has begun
I'm captivated
If you think and get ahead
Get up from bed, just use your head
You know you gotta live brighter

Everything is good under the sun
Go well, you gotta live life brighter
Go well, you gotta live life brighter
Go well, you gotta live life brighter
Go well, you gotta live life brighter

A new day
Running free and nobody can stop me
'Cause life just gets brighter and brighter
A new day
If you and I made it this far
Oh there's no need to worry
There's no need to worry

Forever thankful for the love
Another day has begun

Get up from bed, just use your head
You know you gotta live brighter

She found me on a balcony
In my head I was living dead
Standing so close to the edge
Wanted to be free so I didn't see that
She was there, I didn't even care
Until she threw her arms around me
And said ""don't you ever give in""
I know you're tired, but I swear
You'll never have a nightmare again

If you just let me sing this lullaby for you,
Don't want you to cry so just
Close your eyes now and sleep
And sleep (for a little while)
While I sing this lullaby for you
Just know that I am here for you
You can rest here with me
And when you wake you'll see

Lullabye-bye
For the pain and the sorrow
Lullabye-bye
When you wake up tomorrow
You can bid goodbye
To every tear that you ever cried
With this lullaby
(With this lulla-lulla-bye-bye)

When she found me
I was lost at sea with
Lightning flashing, waves were crashing
The storm was blowing me away
Drowning endlessly in
My own misery and
I couldn't breathe, I wanted to leave
Until she threw her arms around me
And said ""don't you ever give in""
I know you're tired, but I swear
You'll never have a nightmare again

If you just let me sing this lullaby for you,
Don't want you to cry so just
Close your eyes now and sleep
And sleep (for a little while)
While I sing this lullaby for you
Just know that I am here for you
You can rest here with me

For the pain and the sorrow
Lullabye-bye
When you wake up tomorrow
You can bid goodbye
To every tear that you ever cried
With this lullaby
(With this lulla-lulla-bye-bye)

And I was about to give up
Just wanted all my nightmares to stop
But then she saved my life
The night she said to me

Let me sing this lullaby for you,
Don't want you to cry so just
Close your eyes now and sleep
And sleep
While I sing this lullaby for you
Just know that I am here for you
You can rest here with me
And when you wake you'll see

Lullabye-bye
For the pain and the sorrow

Or maybe I'm confused when you are near me

There's only one thing in my mind
That's you and me

I'm a little bit of crazy
I'm a little bit of a fool
I'm a little bit of lonely
I'm a little bit of all
Oh, I need a cure
Just a little bit of you
And I will fall

I'm always on a run to see you
Would you allow me to?
It wasn't my intention to hurt you

Was I really blind to give you my trust?
Didn't think your love was dangerous

You were never there when I need you most
I found my way when I was lost
Never had a hand for me to hold
Your heart was really cold

You showed me who you are
Can't believe we made it this far
I gave you my heart
But all I ever got were nasty scars

Now I'm done
Being a fool for ya
I'm so done

Give me back the time and the attention
After all I was just one of your possession, aye
Don't know what I been doing, uh
All the times we had we just been messing up
I don't even wanna see you try to make it up
Stop holding the door so you can just get out
Stop holding your breath cos you be choking on your words like you had none of that
And in any other case know that you can be replaced and your pretty little face isn't backing up your case, you disgrace
Okay, why you still complaining boy?
You toy, like the ones I had when I was four
I don't even need you in my life anymore

This foot off the break, so
Give it to you straight, I'ma hit you with the breakdown
Catching feelings for you, can you tell me how you feel now?

Tell me why even if I gave you my life
You still mad at me
Tell me what the hell would suffice

"""Catching One Lemonade (Live at myxRADIO)""",Inigo Pascual,No Album,"

She's my sunshine in the rain
She's my Tylenol when I'm in pain, yeah
Let me tell you what she means to me

Like a tall glass of lemonade
When it's burning hot on summer days
She's exactly what I need

Said she's soothing like the ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me, baby
And she helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful, sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what I need
She's exactly what I need

Just came from another mistake
Just another heartbreak
Repeating it over and over til our hearts break
Losing my mind every time with ya
Back to the wringer and we always hit rewind, baby

Say something stupid and you start to see red
I'm tryna please you but I'm losing my head
Think I needa bounce, let me out,
Hit the ground, running til I drop dead

But everytime you tell me that you love me
Everytime you tell me that you want me
Making me feel and think
It's the same inside
I would keep it to myself but I gotta let you know that

I'm catchin' feelings for ya
I'm catchin' feelings for ya
Gotta let you know that I'm catchin' feelings for ya
I'm catchin' feelings, feelings
Yeah

I'm catchin' feelings for ya
I'm catchin' feelings for ya
Gotta let you know that I'm catchin' feelings for ya
I'm catchin' feelings, feelings
Yeah

He way you laugh with your mouth closed
The way you smile so your eyes glow
It's in the way you look at me
So I can see just who I am inside
The way my heart doesn't listen
And so it just keeps wishing
Wishing you were close to me so that its beat
Will synchronize with yours

You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one for me
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one for me, now
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one for me
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one for me

Your hand and mine
Fit perfectly fine
And sway below our waists
At the perfect height
Faithful and true
To Him and to you
I will stay
Forever this way because

You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one for me
(I'm catchin' feelings for ya)
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one for me, now

You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one for me

"""Extensyon""",Inigo Pascual,No Album,"

Tatlong taon apat na buwan
Tayong magkasama
Ikaw at ako tayo noon
Ngunit ngayo'y wala na na
Nais mo pa sanang magbaka sakaling bumalik
Ang init ng yakap at halik

Ngunit merong mga pangyayari
Na hindi na maaari
Ikaw ang bumitaw
Sa kamay kong hawak mo na na na
Nang mahigpit nawala ang kapit at masakit
Alalahanin ang 'di na babalik

Ako'y nangamba ha ha ha
Na biglang gusto mo pa
Tanggap ko na na na na na
Na tayo ay wala na
Tanggapin mo na rin
Na hindi ka para sakin
Iba na lang wag na ako
Dahil alam ko nang tayo'y

Wala ng babalikan itigil na ang ilusyon
Sayang lang ang oras at ang panahon
Talikdan na ang magulong sitwasyon
Ang masaktan ka ay hindi intension
Kung nabunot man ang saksakan ng
Pag-ibig na nagbunga ng maling desisyon
Ito ang leksyon sa aking bagong misyon
Kapag nandyan si ex siguradong may tension

Woah oh oh woah oh woah oh
Woah oh oh woah

Labis labis akong nabahala
Nang ako ay meron ng iba
Ikaw laging ikaw
Ang kontra sa eksena nanalig
Ka pa rin hanapin ang wagas na damdamin
Na alam mong 'di na sa atin kaya

Wala ng babalikan itigil na ang ilusyon
Sayang lang ang oras at ang panahon
Talikdan na ang magulong sitwasyon
Ang masaktan ka ay hindi intension

Kung nabunot man ang saksakan ng
Pag-ibig na nagbunga ng maling desisyon
Ito ang leksyon sa aking bagong misyon
Kapag nandyan si ex siguradong may tension

Tensionado, kabado at batid ko na iyong napuna
Maalab na pag-ibig natin ngayon ay limot ko na
Ang dating mapula, kumupas na bigla
Namutla at tila nawalan na ng sigla
Ang mali sayo ikaw lagi ang tama
Napagod at nagsawa na ako sa gantong drama
Kaya ang puso ko nagkusang lumayo sayo
Pinilit layuan isipan mo na magulo
Bagama't pinagtagpo pero di nakatadhana
Ang tunay na ligaya ay nasa pagpapalaya
Hindi man nagwakas sa magandang paraan
Kalimutan na lang natin ang ating nakaraan
At tandaan na sayo ay may nakalaan
Hindi man ako yon maaaring nariyan
Harapin at tanggapin mo ang katotohanan
Na ang lahat ng bagay ay mayroong hangganan

Kung nabunot man ang saksakan ng
Pag-ibig na nagbunga ng maling desisyon
Ito ang leksyon sa aking bagong misyon
Kapag nandyan si ex siguradong may tension

Wala na wala na wala ka ng babalikan itigil na ang ilusyon

"""Goodbye""",Inigo Pascual,No Album,"

Today at noon's when you called me and
Said how ya' doing? Remember those days
Yea I smiled said I'm good and I
Still think of you but you wanted change

Now let those moments be memories written on a page
Let us go and let your mind be blind

No matter how hard it is
Leave the past in the past
But you gotta know when to say goodbye
Maybe we weren't destined
But we can't say we didn't try
Just know that we had some good in goodbye
Goodbye

Listen soon I'll be gone and you
Won't even know my face or my name
And my calls will go to voicemail cause'
You won't even have the time of day

So let these moments be memories written on a page
Let us go, let your mind be blind

No matter how hard it is
Leave the past in the past
But you gotta know when to say goodbye
Maybe we weren't destined
But we can't say that we didn't try
But you gotta know (we) had some good in goodbyes

Do not live with regret
Anything could happen
Everything happens for a reason

We know people do change
So we learn to let go
But life goes on

No matter how hard it is
Leave the past in the past
But you gotta know when to say goodbye
Maybe we weren't destined
But we can't say we didn't try
Oh we can say we had some good in goodbye

"""Hagdan""",Inigo Pascual,No Album,"

Araw-araw ay kabaliktaran ang swerte
Mukha lang inosente pero pwede mag rebelde
Ginagawa kong kapre ang bawat mga dwende
Kung minsan ang kulay pulay ginagawa kong berde
Nakasagutan ko si nanay
Si utol nakaaway
Hindi na ko umuuwi ng bahay
Nagpunta sa kapitbahay
Nakitulog, nakitambay
Naki-uso, nakibagay
Naki-usok, nakitagay
Pinakain ko ng damo ang pulang kabayo
Paulit-ulit lang umaasang may magbabago
Binusog ko lang lalo ang ari kong pagkatao
Pagnagtalo yung dalawang aso, yung mabuti yung talo
Napalayo sa riyalidad
Naglalakad ako ngunit akala ko ako'y lumilipad
Naging tamang hinala
Panay maling akala
Hinahabol ko ang tama
At mukhang mali na ata

Gusto kong maglayag
Gusto kong mga pangarap ko, mangyari agad
Gusto kong lumangoy
Gusto kong lumipad
Pakiramdam ko kaya kong gawin ang lahat
Teka, wag kang magmadali
Dahan-dahan lang (dahan-dahan lang)
Tayo ay para lang humahakbang paakyat ng hagdan

Gusto kong maglayag

Teka, wag kang magmadali
Dahan-dahan lang (dahan-dahan lang)
Tayo ay para lang humahakbang paakyat ng hagdan

May araw na malas, may araw ring swerte
Tanggap ko nang pula'y hindi pwede maging berde
Hindi madali pero posible
Kung ang lahat ng bagay ay gagawin kong simple
May mga taong inilagay para ako'y itumba
Isang kalabit nalang at ako'y puputok na
Ganto ata talaga kapag ang puno ay mabunga
Binabato-bato ng may mahulog at makuha
Sa aking kahinaan ay naging malakas
Lalo akong tumingin paloob imbis palabas
Isinapuso ko di ako masyadong nag-isip
Ng kung ano-ano lalo ko lang niyakap ang inip
At ako ay nagpasakop sa programa
Sa tulong ng aking mga bagong kasama
Ako ay nakabangon sa kama
Muli kong nasilayan ang isang bagong umaga

Gusto kong maglayag
Gusto kong mga pangarap ko, mangyari agad
Gusto kong lumangoy
Gusto kong lumipad
Pakiramdam ko kaya kong gawin ang lahat
Teka, wag kang magmadali
Dahan-dahan lang (dahan-dahan lang)
Tayo ay para lang humahakbang paakyat ng hagdan

Gusto kong maglayag
Gusto kong mga pangarap ko, mangyari agad

Keep our love alive, I'll never fade away
If you close your eyes and let the music play
Keep our love alive, I'll never fade away
If you close your eyes and let the music play
Keep our love alive, I'll never fade away

Remember me
For I will soon be gone
Remember me
And let the love we have live on
And know that I'm with you the only way that I can be
So until you're in my arms again
Remember me yeah
Remember me yeah
Remember me

We both made mistakes
It's what it is
Who am I not to forgive?
Won't point the blame
Won't call no names
I know you still feel the same

Oh-nah-nah, don't worry now
If love is in your heart, we're gonna figure out
Never let go, stay together
Got me like, oh now, now, you'll see the light
The sun is on your side through the dark times
And I'll be there if ever you feel lonely

Soon as the waves die down
We'll keep on rising
My hands won't let you drown
Just keep fighting for me
Don't let your fears give you pain when it's storming
Soon as the waves die down
We'll keep on rising

Some of these days just feel different
I'm feeling the weight of the world
I'm praying to whoever listens
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout tomorrow
Tell me, why should we cry some more?

Oh-nah-nah, don't worry now
If love is in your heart, we're gonna figure out
Never let go, stay together
And oh now, now, you'll see the light
The sun is on your side through the dark times
And I'll be there if ever you feel lonely

Soon as the waves die down
We'll keep on rising
My hands won't let you drown
Just keep fighting for me
Don't let your fears give you pain when it's storming
Soon as the waves die down
We'll keep on rising

If nothing is fair, try forgiveness
I'm only human like you
And living with hate just leaves bruises
And if we all have a purpose
Why do we keep hurting?

And oh-nah-nah, don't worry now
If love is in your heart, we're gonna figure out
Never let go, stay together
And oh now, now, you'll see the light
The sun is on your side through the dark times
And I'll be there if ever you feel lonely

Soon as the waves die down
We'll keep on rising
My hands won't let you drown
Just keep fighting for me
Don't let your fears give you pain when it's storming
Soon as the waves die down
We'll keep on rising

The world turns and we still learn
What it is to be somebody
When time's hard, we pray hard
Lord, give me a sign today

Let's find ways and better days
Understand and take some time, and
As the world turns, we'll still learn
We're all gonna be okay

Soon as the waves die down
We'll keep on rising
My hands won't let you drown
Just keep fighting for me
Don't let your fears give you pain when it's storming
Soon as the waves die down
We'll keep on rising

Soon as the waves die down
We'll keep on rising
My hands won't let you drown
Just keep fighting for me
Don't let your fears give you pain when it's storming
Soon as the waves die down
We'll keep on rising

Kamusta
Balita may pangamba sa 'yong sarili
Teka lang muna dito't makinig ka

Ako subong mabangka, maarangka, prangka nga istorya
Hindi ka magkabalaka sa mga gakatabo nga mga trahedya
Hindi pag kompara lawas mo sa ila kay
Mabulukon ang atung kalibutan

Maong kung ako pa nimo

Maong buhata ang taan

"""What U Want""",Inigo Pascual,No Album,"

Well, I guess life has been lately
So exhausting, pressure's pumping
All the hurt and the pain
They keep you going to the same direction
And you're feeling so down
And you wanna breakdown
You just but had enough of things
That blow your mind
And you say...

What is it with all these loose and chances
Endless consequences
You don't know where to go
Just to hide yourself
Escape your mad situation
You wanna say no
But you gotta let go
Even though you really don't want these things in your life
And you say...

I know what you want
I know what you need
If you're tired of it all
Just give it to me, yeah
I know what you want
I know what you need
Just believe and be saved and you'll be free

Just keep your cool and put all your trust in me
And you will see
Entrust your life and just leave it up to me
And you will see, yeah

I know what you want, I know what you need
I know what you want, I know what you need
I know what you want, I know what you need
I know what you want, I know what you need

Wanna do what's right but end up
Toying with the wrong intention
Turn away from the way that's got you
Struggling in the wrong direction
Now you wanna move on
But you gotta be strong
Gotta give up, giving in to the voices
In your mind making you scream

Here we go, the same old show
Seems like you're losing the war in your head
Some serious actions going on now making you wish you were dead
You wanna hold on, you wanna move on
Wanna give up, wanna give in
Wanna lift it up, surrender it all
(Give me a break, give me a break, come on!)

I know what you want, I know what you need
I know what you want, I know what you need
That's why you need someone who loves you
Knows your needs and gives it to you
Joy and peace, each day is new
You'll be tranquil, brave and still be fine

I know what you want
I know what you need
If you're tired of it all
Just give it to me, yeah
I know what you want
I know what you need
Just believe and be saved and you'll be free

Just keep your cool and put all your trust in me
And you will see
Entrust your life and just leave it up to me
And you will see, yeah

I know what you want
I know what you need
If you're tired of it all
Just give it to me, yeah
I know what you want
I know what you need
Just believe and be saved and you'll be free

Well, I guess life has been lately

They keep you going to the same direction
And you're feeling so down
And you wanna breakdown
You just but had enough of things

And you say

I know what you want
I know what you need
If you're tied of it all
Just give it to me, yeah
I know what you want
I know what you need
Just believe and be saved and you'll be free
