Tumatalon ang puso ko
Susunod nalang sa'yo
Wag mawala, bilangin ko
Anim, tatlong sampu't tatlo

Saan tayo pupunta?
Dinig mo ba? Dinig ko ba?
Sa labi mo nag umpisa
Alingawngaw, dinggin ko na

Pakinggan ang mga yapak
Magtatagpo pag naghanap
Kahit saan man mapadpad
Mahahanap din sa iyong palad

Lay down a while
The sky could be falling
Lay it down a while
'Cause soon comes the morning

Your mind has a tongue and your tongue is a gun
That can cause a great big fire
Your heart is a child being trained in the wild
'Til you know your true desire

Count all your mornings
But don't heed every warning
Come on, let's take shelter
In the arms of our brother

Your mind has a tongue and your tongue is a gun
That can cause a great big fire
Your heart is a child being trained in the wild
'Til you know your true desire

Lay your load on me
Peace where do you go
Lay your load on me
Peace where do you go

Lay your load on me
Peace where do you go

Peace where do we go

Twenty-three you knew you've seen this from before
Quiet and confused always breaking through the door
Thought the world was easy, all the places to go
And you sleep soundly when you don't know

One day you wake up and the colors aren't the same
You laugh and cry and pray just to get back in the game
When the world was easy, all the places to go
And you sleep soundly when you don't know

Days are long, but years they fly
You set your heart where you fix your eyes
So let me fix my eyes on you...

When my time is done, and all the songs have been sung
You'll always be the name on the tip of my tongue
And the world was easy, all the places to go
And you sleep soundly when it's time to go

Days are long, but years they fly
You set your heart where you fix your eyes
Days are long, but years they fly
You set your heart where you fix your eyes
Oh, let me fix my eyes on you...

I know you need somebody
To be there by your side
You know I'm always ready
To do what makes you smile

Don't go looking elsewhere
For someone prettier than me
Are they brighter, stronger, sweeter?
Look into my eyes, you'll see

Why can't it be me?
Why can't I be your best buddy?
The places we could see
Hand on my head
Choose me instead
I've so much love to give, you'll see

I don't need fancy dresses
Or shoes for my little feet
No need for pedigree or papers
To show you what you mean to me

I'll be always faithful
If you choose to take me home
Look beyond what's on the outside
You know I'll live for you alone

Why can't it be me?
Why can't I be your best buddy?
The places we could see
Hand on my head
Choose me instead
I've so much love to give, you'll see

I dream of a day when I'm old and gray
When I can't run so far anymore
But there you'd be as you promised me
Yours will be the last face I'll see
'Cause yes it could be me

Oh, can I be your best buddy?
The places we could see
Hand on my head
Choose me instead
I've so much love to give, you'll see

On the open coast
Staring out in wonder
I never would've known
We would find each other

Driving down the same road all these years
And living in the same cloud
My head in a whirl wasting all those hours
Yet here you are now
Here you are now

When I was cold you were my cover
You let me inside your heart
And I will go with you forever
Let nothing keep us apart
'Cause He built this right from the start

Ordinary day
Back in Pixie Hollow
I never could've known
But where you lead I will follow

Driving down the long road all these years
Molded by the same fire
My heart in His hands waiting all those hours
Yet here we are now
Here we are now

When I was cold you were my cover
You let me inside your heart
And I will go with you forever
Let nothing keep us apart

Naghananap kung saan saan

Would you be interested in dancing with me
And maybe tell me all your dreams
Talk to me like you would in your sleep
Don't censor anything
'Cause I want to hear everything
There's no innocence left to spoil
You can swear she's not a little boy
We'll fly tonight so far away
Where they will never find us
Use your wings and I will run fast
'Cause that's what I do when I'm not afraid
We've got it made up in our heads
We don't have to wait for anyone or anything
Go anywhere we desire

So close your eyes become blind
From the world listen instead to the girl
She'll tell you why she chose to fly
And you're left behind
Just like me alone and free

We can smile when we've filled the void
And treated the burn
But until then I believe
We're gonna have to learn
To discard any disguise we're using
Yes it's hard and it's never amusing

So close your eyes become blind
From the world listen instead to the girl
She'll tell you why she chose to fly
And you're left behind
Just like me alone and free

'Cause I know you in my mind
Everything will be different

We can take the whole wide world
With your boyish charm
And even as you pull me close
I want to stay in your arms

Kumapit sa nag-iisang pag-ibig

'Di na 'ko maiilang
Nawala na ang mga hadlang
Awitin na ikaw lamang

Ikaw lamang ang makakabuo
Sa nawawalang mga piraso ko
Ikaw lamang ang makakabuo
Ang natatanging lunas sa pagkabalisang
Dinudulot ng butas sa bawat nilalang

Ang natatanging lunas sa pagkabalisang
Dinudulot ng butas sa bawat nilalang

Matalinhaga man and paglubog ng araw
Wala pa ring papantay sa'yo
Mayumi man ang buwan sinubukan akong itahan
Iba pa rin ang hele ng duyan mo

Tuloy-tuloy lamang umiikot ang mundo dahil sa'yo
Tuloy-tuloy lamang dumadaloy ang katapatan mo

Yahâweh! Yahâweh!

Binubulong ng hangin ang aking panalangin
Lahat ito'y pinpakinggan mo. (Pinapakinggan mo)
Iniiyak ng ulan ang luha at damdamin
Binubuo muli ang puso ko (Binubuo muli ang puso)

Tuloy-tuloy lamang ang papuri ng mga likhain mo
Tuloy-tuloy lamang aawit at sasamba sa'yo
Sayo...

20 times I recall, but it's been five years
I was living fast
Squeezing to the last drop of dopamine

But it's not what it seems
'Cause I know that we all come down again
And I need you, but I can't pretend

That I love you when I'm running
Oh I know how it all turns out
And I'm honest, but then I'm lying
Oh I can't put my trust in my
Wicked heart

I've said too many times I apologize
I know I'm to blame
For too many crashes love burns to ash
When I stoke every flame

It's not what it seems
'Cause I know that it all comes down again
(Lower than the last time)
'Cause I'm happy but it always ends

I can't love you when I'm running
Oh I know how it all turns out
And I'm honest, but then I'm lying
Oh I can't put my trust in my
Wicked heart

Many times I've said ""I'm sorry"" but I just can't explain
How do you keep yourself from doing it again?
My heart gets me in trouble is there a different way
God please save me from this wicked heart

I can't love you when I'm running
Oh I know how it all turns out
And I'm honest, but then I'm lying

But let it happen
It's all so clear

Higher than high, but don't lose a feeling
Gonna strech my wings beyond the sky
I don't need a reason
Higher than high, we've had enough confusion
Carry me back, carry me back
Please take me back

Don't sit home alone
Follow the stars ahead
Maybe you have some doubts
Or maybe it's just the feeling
To let it go, let go

- Hello?
- Hello
- Hey, who's this?
- It's Billy
- Oh, hey Billy. What's up?
- Not much. Why didn't you come to the party last night?
- I had things to do Billy...
- Can we talk or something, you know... I mean...
- No Billy, I gotta go
- Oh...
- See ya
- Bye...

Higher than high, but don't lose a feeling
Gonna stretch my wings beyond the sky
I don't need a reason
Higher than high, we've had enough confusion
Carry me back, carry me back
Please take me back

Higher than high, but don't lose a feeling
Gonna stretch my wings beyond the sky
I don't need a reason
Higher than high, we've had enough confusion
Carry me back, carry me back
Please take me back...

It's driving me crazy

There ain't no stopping me

Compare to you my love

When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, oh nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name and
You know wherever I am I'll come running
To see you again
Winter spring summer or fall
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will
You got a friend

If the sky above you should turn dark
And full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow
Keep your hands together
And call my name out loud
Soon I'll be knocking upon your door

You just call out my name and
You know wherever I am I'll come running
To see you again
Winter spring summer or fall
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will

Ain't it good to know you got a friend
When people could be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
Well they'll take your soul if you let them
But don't you let them

With someone like you

A ceux qui pensent que l'amour met genoux
Que pour y croire encore, il n'y a plus que nous
Je dis que r'ver plus haut
Ce n'est pas que pour les h'ros
A ceux qui voient l'amour comme un d'fi
Et le coeur, comme un ennemi
Je dis qu'ils verront bien
Que j'aurai toujours ma main dans ta main

Si tout ne tient qu un fil
Si fragile, on va tout changer
Et quitte' tout laisser
Tu verras
Qu'un jour je ne pourrai pas
Me passer de toi

Si tout ne tient qu un fil
Invisible, on peut l'arracher
Et quitte' tout l'cher
Tu verras
Qu'un jour je ne pourrai pas
Me passer de toi

There really is someone for every one
I didn't believe until you touched me
And that's when I know dreams do come true
And so I promise you I'm gonna stay

Cause what we have is so real
The way I feel they can't take away
No matter what they say
'Cause I know
I know I can stay in love
With someone like you

Si tout ne tient qu un fil
Si fragile, on va tout changer
Et quitte' tout laisser
Tu verras
Qu'un jour je ne pourrai pas
Me passer de toi

Si tout ne tient qu un fil
Invisible, on peut l'arracher
Et quitte' tout l'cher
Tu verras
Qu'un jour je ne pourrai pas
Me passer de toi...

Steamy nights in Puerto Rico, all of my people... ooh yeah

It was dream like, well it seemed like, it was so surreal on the real
Dancing to my groove, sweat drips, bodies moving
I wanna take you on a ride now
So won't you sit back and close your eyes now and imagine

Steamy nights in Puerto Rico, hotel room at the four seas-o
San Juan on down montego, this jam's here is for all of my people
Then off to old San Paolo, carnival in Trinidad-o
Come on we can share a bottle, if you feeling me holl-o
Holl-o, holl-o

Shirts off, shorts tight, beach house by the moonlight
Making out till the tide comes in, skinny dip, want to take a swim
Bodies crash like waves, save your problems for the rainy days
If you not going to party then get out the way
Cause the party's on when you hear the people say

Steamy nights in Puerto Rico, hotel room at the four seas-o
San Juan on down montego, this jam's here is for all of my people
Then off to old San Paolo, carnival in Trinidad-o
Come on we can share a bottle, if you feeling me holl-o
Holl-o, holl-o, holl-o

"""Could It Be I'm Fallin' In Love""",Billy Crawford,"""Groove""","

Since I met you I've begun to feel so strange
Every time I speak your name (that's funny)
You say that you are so helpless too
That you don't know what to do

Each night I pray there will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too and I wonder what
It is I feel for you

Could it be I'm falling in love (with you baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love (ooh)
Could it be I'm falling in love
With you, with you, with you

I don't need all those things that used to bring me joy
You made me such a happy boy
And honey, you'll always be the only one for me
Meeting you was my destiny

You can be sure I will never let you down
When you need me, I will be around
And darling you'll always be the only one for me
Heaven made you specially

Could it be I'm falling in love (with you baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love (ooh)
Could it be I'm falling in love
With you, with you, with you

And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be

A lovely day...
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day...)

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Girl, then I look at you
And the world's alright with me

And nothing, oh nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me

To brighten up even your darkest night

All you got to do is call

And full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow
Keep your hands together

And there you were
Needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Touching my emotions

I wanna stop

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you, you, you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life?
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went you know I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways

I wanna stop
And thank you baby

And thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you, you, you, you

You were better to me than I was to myself

"""Never Let Her Slip Away""",Billy Crawford,"""Groove""","

I talked to my baby on the telephone
Long distance
I never would've guessed
I could miss someone so bad, yeah
I really only met her 'bout a week ago
But it doesn't seem to matter to my heart
I know that I love her
I'm hoping that I never recover
Cause she's good for me
And it would really make me happy
To never let her slip away

I feel like a kid with a teenage crush
On a school date
I feel like the lead in ""Romeo & Juliet""
I'm a little bit dizzy, I'm a little bit scared
I guess I never felt this much aware
That I'd love her
I'm hoping that I'll never recover
Cause she's good for me
And it would really make me happy
To never let her slip away

Never, never, never let her slip away

Across the night-time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the night-time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature

To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere

Across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

"""One Last Cry""",Billy Crawford,"""Groove""","

My shattered dreams and broken heart
Are mending on a shelf I saw you
Holding hands standing close to someone else
Now I sit all alone
Wishing all my feeling was gone
I gave my best to you
Nothing for me to do

But I have one last cry
One last cry before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind
This time stop living in lie
I guess I'm done to my last cry

I was here you were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun shines on you
I need some love to rain on me
Still I sit all alone
Wishing all my feeling was gone
Gotta get over you
Nothing for me to do

But I have one last cry
One last cry before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind
This time stop living a lie

I know I've gotta be strong
Cause round me life goes on
And on, and on...

I'm gonna dry my eyes
Right after my hand and my...

One last cry, one last cry
Before I'll leave it all behind
Ive gotta put you out of my mind
For the very last time
Believe in lie, I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down, I guess I'm down
To my last cry...

Turned into a gentle kiss or two

Somehow found my someone

Close to you

When the world's asleep
And we're sharing sweet
Solitude
Almost gave up
Trying to find someone else in love

Long walk
Soft talk
Still can't believe it

Someone just like me
Running into someone just like you
An accidental touch
Turned into a gentle kiss or two
Love has finally come
Somehow found my someone
Yes, I did

Was that me?
Not long ago
No one here to care
No one's dreams to share
You agree
Nights can be rough
When you can't find someone else in love

Long walk
Soft talk
Hard to believe it
What were the odds of

Someone just like me
Running into someone just like you
An accidental touch
Turned into a gentle kiss or two
Love has finally come
Somehow found my someone

You and me
All alone
That's my favorite time of night
Nothing for us to do
But finding ways to hold each other tight...

Imagine that's be me

Someone just like me
Running into someone just like you
An accidental touch
Turned into a gentle kiss or two
Love has finally come

I know it gets hard on you
When I'm dippin' in an out of town
Your friends keep asking why
They never see your man around

Tell them

(I'll be back girl, you ain't got to worry)
Just tryin' get my paper right
(I'll be back girl for you in a hurry)
To give you all the finer things in life

I'm just headed for the stars
Gotta do what I gotta do
I'm just headed for the stars
But I swear I'm coming back for you

Cause it don't mean nothing
If I ain't got you
This is just something that I got to do
I'm just headed for the stars
But I swear I'm coming back for you

See girl, I left my heart at home
You're the only thing that I got that's real
Don't listen to the haters, girl
Cause they don't know how we feel

This is for the both of us

Girl you're right on time you really blow my mind
