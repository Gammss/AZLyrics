Sa buhay kong ito
Tanging pangarap lang
Ang iyong pag mamahal
Ay makamtan
Kahit na sandali
Ikaw ay mamasdan
Ligaya'y tila ba
Walang hanggan
Sana'y di na magising
Kung nangangarap man din
Kung ang buhay na makulay
Ang tatahakin
Minsan ay nadarapa
Minsan din ay luluha
Di ka na maninimdim
Pagkat sa buhay mo
Ay may nag mamahal parin

Iingatan ka
Aalagaan ka
Sa puso ko ikaw ang pag-asa
Sa 'ting mundo'y
May gagabay sa iyo
Ang alay ko'y itong pagmamahal ko
May nag mamahal aakay sa iyo
Aking inay ikaw ang nagbigay
Ng buhay ko
Buhay na kay ganda
Pangarap ko na makamtan ko na

Sana'y di na magising

"""Only World""",Carol Banawa,"""Carol""","

It is time to change our ways
Speak a one united phrase
In every song that we sing
In every dream that we dream
Telling it is up to us to decide

All the conflicts in our hearts
Let's forget the way it starts
Let's be together like then
Together hand and hand
For this world can be stronger again

For we were born in love
That's how we came about
The time has come for us
To make our voice as one in sharing
Replace the hate we have with caring
So happy we can be
If we would all agree
And there would be delight
For all the things we see
Let's cherish
The only world we have

All the conflicts in our hearts
Let's forget the way it starts
Let's be together like then
Together hand and hand
For this world can be stronger again

To make our voice as one in sharing
Replace the hate we have with caring
So happy we can be

For all the things we see
Let's cherish
The only world we have

Ooh one love is all that we need
Ooh one earth is all that we have
We were given hearts to love
By the heavens up above

Yeah... Yeah

Ooh we were born in love
That's how we came about
The time has come for us
To make our voice as one in sharing
Replace the hate we have with caring
So happy we can be

I just, can't tell
This feeling here inside me

Whenever you are near me

Everytime I see you pass I smile
But then you never seem to realize
Its for your eyes
If you would say hello
It would be nice

[Chorus:]
Your in my mind
Almost all the time
Every single minute all I do is think of you
And deep inside
In this heart of mine
I have to go on wishing till its time

One day, you came
And you are oh so near me
I smiled, and then
You turn and did not see me
How am I supposed to get to meet you
What should I do
Your in my dreams, I feel it seems
That you don't feel it queit the way I do

"""Kanino Ba""",Carol Banawa,"""Carol""","

Laging may nagsasabi
Pag-ibig muna'y iisantabi
Dahil bata pa raw ang katulad ko
At baka magsisi lang sa huli

Ako'y laging nakikinig
Ngunit minsa'y napipilit
Dahil may kakaibang nadarama
Nguni't 'di ko lang alam kung bakit

Kanino ba ako lalapit
Upang sabihin ang laman ng dibdib
Kung mayro'n mang manliligaw sa akin
Agad ko ba siyang sasagutin
O maghihintay ng tamang panahon
'Pagkat darating naman din iyon

Ang susundin ko ba ay kayo
O ang bulong ng puso ko

Baka ako ay magkamali

What is this strange new feeling
That I've never felt before
Could my heart's beating be revealing
Feelings unexplored
When first I saw you standing there
A sailor, prince or king
With such a strong commanding air
You seemed to shine over everything

And when you raised your voice
It seemed to echo all around
You sang of all your joys
And of the love you haven't found
And hearing of your heart's desire
A stirring uncontrolled
Burst from within like fatal fire
Is this what they call
""Love with all your soul?""

How can a human know
What I don't know
How can a human soul
Enchant me so
Or can it be the joy
This man expresses
Faith he professes
Is a guarantee
He could learn to love
Someone like me

But as I hold you close like this
You calm my strange unease
If I should wake you with a kiss
Would you lead me to
Such a love, oh please

But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd

I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony of summer air
See the lights
See the party, the ball gowns
I see you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo
You were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said
Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go

And I said
Romeo, take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting
All there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince
And I'll be the princess
It's a love story
Baby just say, yes

So I sneak out
To the garden to see you
We keep quite
'Cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this down for a little while

'Cause you were Romeo
I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said
Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you
Please don't go

Romeo, take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting

You'll be the prince
And I'll be the princess

Baby just say yes
Romeo save me
They try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult
But it's real
Don't be afraid
We'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story
Baby just say, yes

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you would ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said
Romeo save me
I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting
For you but you never come
Is this in my head
I don't know what to think
He kneels to the ground
And pulled out a ring and said
Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you
And that's all I really know
I talk to your dad
Go pick out a white dress

"""Colour Everywhere""",Christian Bautista,"""Christian Bautista""","

Used to seeing black and white
Never really in between
Waiting for the love of my life
To come into my dreams
Everything is shades of gray
Never really blues or green

Needed someone else to turn to
Someone who could help me learn to see
All the beauty that was waiting for me

You, you put the blue back in the sky
You put the rainbow in my eyes
A silver lining in my prayers
And now there's colour everywhere

You put the red back in the rose
Just when I needed it the most
You came along to show you care
And now there's colour everywhere
Everywhere

My life is so predictable
Never any mystery
But ever since you shined the light
All of that was history
Now I have a hand to hold
And a reason to believe
There's someone in my life worth living for
I was hanging around just wishing on a star
To put the happines back in my heart and...

You, you put the blue back in the sky
You put the rainbow in my eyes
A silver lining in my prayers
And now there's colour everywhere

You put the red back in the rose
Just when I needed it the most
You came along to show you care
And now there's colour everywhere
Oh yeah...

You care and now there's colour everywhere

Left those hazy days behind me
Never to return again
Now they're just a fading memory
Coz baby it's all so clear to see
The beauty that is waiting there for me

You, you put the blue back in the sky
You put the rainbow in my eyes
A silver lining in my prayers
And now there's colour everywhere

You put the red back in the rose
Just when i needed it the most
You came along to show you care
And now there's colour everywhere

There were times that I just wanna cry with all the strain
There were moments of uncertainty and pain
But when you are there to help and care, I smile again
But here am I so alone away from you

[Chorus:]
Everyday I can only pray for your warm, lovin' arms
To take me away from all the emptiness, despair
Why do I have to be away from you

I have searched throughout the world a lot of things I've seen
I have pondered many possibilities
Then you come along, you make me strong so stay with me
Why am I on my own without you

On my own so far away I long from your warm lovin' arms
Into the cold, dark emptiness of hurt, despair
I don't wanna be away from you

Across the moonlit room
There's so much tenderness in your loving

Tonight I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness

As we move to embrace tears run down your face
I whisper words of love so softly

Of a brighter tomorrow
With hopes from day to day
Rid ourselves of the sorrow

La la la la la la la, la la la la, oh...

I see you, beside me
It's only a dream
A vision of what used to be
The laughter, the sorrow
Pictures in time
Fading to memory
How could I ever let you go
Is it too late to let you know

I try to run from your side
But this place I hide
It only reminds me of you
When I turn out of the light
Even the night
It only reminds me of you

I needed my freedom
That's what I thought
But I was a fool to believe
My heart lied while you cried rivers of tears
But I was too blind to see
Everything we've been
Through before
Now it means so much more

I try to run from your side
But this place I hide
It only reminds me of you
When I turn out of the light
Even the night
It only reminds me of you
Only you

Please come back to me
I'm down on my knees
Girl can't you see

How could I ever let you go
Is it too late to let you know

I try to run from your side
But this place I hide
It only reminds me of you
When I turn out of the light
Even the night
It only reminds me of you
You... oh woah...
It only reminds me of you

You're my piece of mind
In this crazy world
You're every thing
I've tried to find
Your love is a pearl
You're my Mona Lisa
You're my rainbow skies
And my only prayer
Is that you realize
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes

The world will turn
And the seasons will change
And all the lessons we will learn
Will be beautiful and strange
We'll have our fell of tears
Our share of sight
My only prayer is that you realize
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes

You will always be, beautiful in my eyes
And the passing years will show
That you will always grow
Ever more beautiful in my eyes

And there are lines upon my face
From a life time of smiles
When the time comes to embrace
For one long last wine
We can laugh about
How time really flies
We won't say goodbye
'Cause true love never dies
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes

You will always be, beautiful in my eyes
And the passing years will show
That you will always grow
Ever more beautiful in my eyes
The passing years will show
That you will always grow
Ever more beautiful
Ever more beautiful
Ever more beautiful in my eyes

Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

The streets of this town
Trying to find sense of it all
The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears I'd had to waste
Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?

No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain cry for help

As I am now holding you
Trying hard to stop myself
From telling you
That I'm dying inside
That I'm trying to hide
All the feelings that I have for you

Could have been the once to love you
I could have been the one to hold you tight
Be the one to make you see brighter days
Through those lonely nights
I know that you can never really understand
What I'm feeling inside
All I want is for you to know
That I could have been the one

Ohhhhh and I could not believe
That we can never be more than just friends
For in my heart I know that you and I
Will be together in the end
In the end!!!

I could have been the one to love you
Could have been the one to hold you tight
Be the one to make you see brighter days
Through those lonely nights
I know that you can never really understand
What I'm feeling inside
All I want is for you to know

I could have been the one to love you
Could have been the one to hold you tight
Be the one to make you see brighter days
Through those lonely nights
I know that you can never really understand
What I'm feeling inside
All I want is for you to know

That I could have been the one....
I could have been the one....

"""Captured""",Christian Bautista,"""Captured""","

I was captured the moment we met
Carried away with every word you said
It's a mystery how you got to me
I fell in the spell of your charms
With your siren's smile you caught me off guard

Just one glance took away my breath
Then you drew me in with your tenderness
You captivate my soul, I'm enraptured
You knocked me out and you locked me up
Stole my heart like a thief at love
Keep me here in your happy ever after
I'm captured

By the way just in case you care
I'm here to stay, I'm not going anywhere
I took a dive in your deep dark eyes
And I'm never coming up for air
I lost myself in this bond that we share

One sweet kiss took away my breath
Then you drew me in with your tenderness
You captivate my soul, I'm enraptured
You knocked me out and you locked me up
Stole my heart like a thief at love
Hold me tight in your happy ever after

Now you've got the best of me
No one else could hold the key
I'm captured

Just one touch took away my breath
When you drew me in I could not resist
You captivate my soul, I'm enraptured
You knocked me out and you locked me up
Stole my heart like a thief at love
Keep me here in your happy ever after

This would be one of those boring games

You walked into these feelings
You looked at me and smiled

The confusion of first loves kiss
A return to wondering
If the magic of love was this
You merely said hello
And my mind did a stop and go
Can it possibly be
The future for me is you... 
Tell me your name

Won't you tell me your name

Just frightened that you might go
Don't go please stay beside me... 
Wait until I can tell you all my schemes
Chasing rainbows, spinning dreams
Finding someone to love like you...

"""I Remember The Girl""",Christian Bautista,"""Romance Revisited: The Love Songs Of Jose Mari Chan""","

Today I heard them play the song again
An old familiar strain from way back when
Every note and every line
It's always been a favorite song of mine
It used to haunt me so some years ago
Reminds me of a girl I used to know
And although the melody lives on
The memories and the girl are all but gone
And while the song still brings that certain glow
And the words still sing of love I know
It isn't quite the way it was before
I remember the girl
But I don't remember the feeling anymore

The promises we made seemed easier then
As if we knew our love would never end
But seasons change and time erases the tears
As quickly as the rivers disappear

So while the song still brings that certain glow
And the words still sing of love I know
It isn't quite the way it was before
I remember the girl
But I don't remember the feeling

I can't let you pass me by

Afraid that I might say the wrong words and displease you
Afraid for love to fade
Before it can come true
Like a child again
I'm out and lost for words
How does one define a crush combined with longing
Longing to possess you, oh so dearly
And I'm obsessed by you completely
I'll go mad if I can't have you

I can't let you pass me by

"""I Have Fallen In Love""",Christian Bautista,"""Romance Revisited: The Love Songs Of Jose Mari Chan""","

I have fallen in love
with the same woman three times;
In a day spanning 19 years
of tearful joys and joyful tears.

I loved her first when she was young,
enchanting and vibrant, eternally new.
She was brilliant, fragrant,
and cool as the morning dew.

I fell in love with her the second time;
when first she bore her child and mine
always by my side, the source of my strength,
helping to turn the tide.

But there were candles to burn
the world was my concern;
while our home was her domain.
and the people were mine
while the children were hers to maintain;

So it was in those 18 years and a day.
âtill I was detained; forced in prison to stay.

Suddenly sheâs our sole support;
source of comfort,
our wellspring of Hope.
On her shoulders felt the burden of Life.

I fell in love again,
with the same woman the third time.
Looming from the battle,
her courage will never fade

Amidst the hardships she has remained,
undaunted and unafraid.
she is calm and composed,
she is Godâs lovely maid.

But need not die

Calloused by doubts, joys and fears,

Love has to cry

That second golden dawn
When love is true
Still I'll wait
I'll wait for second dawn and you

We'll take each day as it comes
Never leaving the crumbs for the morrow

Loving you with love to last a lifetime

If we all could leave something lasting behind to be remembered by
Just a song for me and then at least I would have tried

Never knew, I could feel like this,
Like I've never seen the sky before
Want to vanish inside your kiss
Everyday I love you more and more
Listen to my heart can you hear it sing
Tellin' me to give you everything
Seasons may change, winter to spring
But I love you, until the end of time

Come what may, come what may
I will love you, until my dying day

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Suddenly moves with such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste
It all revolves around you

And there's no mountain too high, no river too wide
Sing out this song and I'll be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather, and stars may collide
But I love you, I love you
Til the end of time, until the end of time

Come what may, come what may
I will love you, I will love you
Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place

Come what may, come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive?
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high

Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below
Up where the clear winds blow

Some hang on to 'used to be'
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our life out there to find

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high

Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know
Where the clear winds blow

Time goes by, no time to cry
Life's you and I, a life, baby

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high

Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know
Where the clear winds blow

Love lift us up where we belong
Love lift us up where we belong

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love, is your love

'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be

You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think that I care for you

It's amazing how you
Can speak right to my heart.
Without saying a word
You can light up the dark.

Try as I may, I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing.

[Chorus:]
The smile on your face
Lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes
Saying you'll never leave me.
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall.
You say it best when you say nothing at all.

All day long I can hear
People talking out loud.
But when you hold me near (you hold me near)
You drown out the crowd.

Try as they may, they can never define
What's been said between your heart and mine.

[Chorus:]
The smile on your face
Lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes
Saying you'll never leave me.
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall.

Well, here we are again
I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight

Your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me

It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes
Oh, and on the way it grows

I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed
I've been lonely for so long
Trapped in the past, I just can't seem to move on

I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away
Just incase I ever need them again someday
I've been setting aside time
To clear a little space in the corners of my mind

All I want to do is find a way back into love
I can't make it through without a way back into love

I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine
I've been searching but I just don't see the signs
I know that it's out there
There's got to be something for my soul somewhere

I've been looking for someone to shed some light
Not somebody just to get me through the night
I could use some direction
And I'm open to your suggestions

All I want to do is find a way back into love
I can't make it through without a way back into love

And if I open my heart again
I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end

There are moments when I don't know if it's real
Or if anybody feels the way I feel
I need inspiration
Not just another negotiation

All I want to do is find a way back into love
I can't make it through without a way back into love

And if I open my heart to you
I'm hoping you'll show me what to do
And if you help me to start again
You know that I'll be there for you in the end

Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were

Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were.

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again, tell me, would we, could we

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember we simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember the way we were.

The way we were.

My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen.

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray.
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah.
And now that your rose is in bloom, a light hits the gloom on the gray.

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say.
You remain, my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby

Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?

"""An Evening in December""",Christian Bautista,No Album,"

As I wait here in this evening in December
I remember how it felt to be a child
This old house still feels the same
All the family will be here in just a while
I hope daddy gets here first to build the fire
He's the only one who has that special touch
Then my brother with his kids
And my grandma who I love so very much

Oh, I'm glad we'll be together on this evening in December
We'll watch the falling snow and hold each other close
I'm so glad we'll be together for an evening to remember
On this night, on this December night

Sometimes out on the road, it gets so lonely
'Cause I miss those special people I hold dear
Though our calendars are full
At least for this one night, we'll all be here
How the children love this evening in December
And while the smallest ones are playing on the floor
There's a warmth I can't explain
And I feel the love of those who've gone before

Oh, I'm glad we'll be together on this evening in December
We'll watch the falling snow and hold each other close
I'm so glad we'll be together for an evening to remember
On this night, on this December night

Keep the fire burning here until we all come back next year

Oh, I'm glad we'll be together on this evening in December
We'll watch the falling snow and hold each other close
I'm so glad we'll be together for an evening to remember
On this night, on this December night

"""Beautiful To Me""",Christian Bautista,No Album,"

How I love the way you hold me and take both of my hands
But my doubts take over and I just donât understand
Whenever you are with me, everything is alright
Like the stars and the moon gave light to the darkest of nights
Like a child seeing fireworks spread across the sky
This is how I feel for you inside

Youâre beautiful to me
So beautiful to me
It may be so simple but Iâll say it anyway
Youâre beautiful to me

Like the ocean and the waves caress the shore and the sand
Bringing in the soothing breeze, so tender and grand
Like the world is moving in slow motion when you look into my eyes
This is how I feel for you inside

Youâre beautiful to me
So beautiful to me
It may be so simple but Iâll say it anyway
Youâre beautiful, beautiful to me

As the sun reflects upon the sea
You smile so unexpectedly
And here I am trying to catch every moment
You shine wherever place youâre in
Your presence changes everything
Nothing in this world could mean anymore to me than you

Youâre beautiful to me
So beautiful to me
It may be so simple but Iâll say it anyway
Youâre beautiful to me

Rainbows, sunsets, name a few
But not as lovely as you
Youâre beautiful to me

"""Bukas Wala Nang Ulan""",Christian Bautista,No Album,"

Tingnan mo ang mga tala
Nakatago lang sa mga ulap
Pero kita mo ang kislap
Kahit malakas pa ang ulan

Aabot hanggang sa malunod
Para bang di ka makaahon
Naghahanap ka ng kakapitan
Sa walang katapusang ulan

Pero ang di mo alam, hindi ka nag-iisa
Nakaagapay sayo, tiwala lang
Masisilayan mo din ang bahaghari
Dahil bukas ay wala nang ulan

Kaylamig na ng hangin
Binalot ka pa ng dilim
Kahit saan ka tumingin
Luha'y dumarating, nananalangin

Pero ang di mo alam, hindi ka nag-iisa
Nakaagapay sayo, tiwala lang
Masisilayan mo din ang bahaghari
Dahil bukas ay wala nang ulan

Darating at haharapin
Tatanggapin at tatawirin mo rin ang bahaghari
Sana'y malaman mo, di ka nag-iisa
Nakaagapay sayo, tiwala lang
Masisilayan mo din ang bahaghari
Dahil bukas ay wala nang ulan
Dahil bukas ay wala nang ulan

Tingnan mo ang isang tala
Wag kalimutan ang iyong kislap

"""Everybody Hurts""",Christian Bautista,No Album,"

It's been 30 days and 30 nights
Since I heard your voice, saw your smile
They say
This is how the story goes

Wish I would've told you to slow down
Just wanna hold you one more time
And I
Wish that I could let you know

That it's hard to see the truth
When it doesn't matter what you do
You keep trying but it's just not up to you

I know that you wanna save the world
Turn inside out to make it work
But everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
You don't have to carry everyone
You don't have to lose to love someone
'Cause everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes

We've had ups and downs 'cause that is Life
But in the end what really counts is
Love
Wish that I could make you see

That it's alright, it's okay
'Cause the sun is rising anyway
Keep your head up, you will find a better day

I know that you wanna save the world
Turn inside out to make it work
But everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
You don't have to carry everyone
You don't have to lose to love someone
'Cause everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes

Look at yourself in the mirror
And try to be kind to yourself
You're doing everything you can

I know that you wanna save the world
Turn inside out to make it work
But everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
You don't have to carry everyone
You don't have to lose to love someone
'Cause everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes

Just a gentle whisper, told me that you're gone
Leaving only memories, where did we go wrong?
I couldn't find the words then, but let me say them now
I'm still in love with you...

Tell me that you love me, tell me that you care
Tell me that you need me, and I'll be there
I'll be there waiting

I will always love you, I will always stay true
There's no one who loves you like I do
Come to me now
I will never leave you, I will stay here with you
Through the good and bad I will stand true
I'm in love with you

Now we're here together, yesterday has passed
Life is just beginning, close to you at last
And I promise to you, I will always be there
I give my all to you

Living life without you is more than I can bear
Hold me close forever,
I'll be there... I'll be there for you

I will always love you, I will always stay true
There's no one who loves you like I do
This I promise...
I will never leave you, I will stay here with you
Through the good and bad I will stand true
Hold me closer...

Our love is forever, holding us together
Nothing in this world can stop us now
