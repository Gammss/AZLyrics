"""Crazy Love""",Kim Chiu,"""Gwa Ay Di""","

I hate the way you walk
Hate the way you talk
Hate the way you look at me

I hate the way you smile
Hate those big brown eyes
Cause I know there not for me

[Chorus:]
Cause/but we can never be
More than friends and it hurts me
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is you and this
Crazy love, crazy love,
Oh this crazy love, crazy love...

I hate thinking of you
Cause every time I do
I just keep on missing you
And I hate the way I feel every time you're near
Cause it feel like time standing still

[Chorus]

I hate it when you're blue
And how I care for you
Hate the way my heart decides
And I hate those sleepless nights
And the pain I kept inside
But I keep pretending it's all right

[Chorus]

I don't know what to do
Hate me for loving you
Cause I know its wrong for me to say
I love you

"""Gwa Ai Di""",Kim Chiu,"""Gwa Ay Di""","

Ikaw, nag-iisang ikaw
Nagbibigay lakas na kayanin ang pagsubok ng mundo
Kung wala masukuban kapag umuulan
Asahan mo nandito lang ako

[Chorus:]
Hanggang sa ating pagtanda
Lagi kong patatanda Gwa Ai Di
Asahan mo ang puso ko ay para lang sayo
Minamahal kita Gwa Ai Di

Mula ngayon at kailanman
Ang puso ko ay sa iyo lamang
Pilitin man ang panahon
Ilayo tayong dal'wa
Ikaw pa rin ang hahanapin ko
Kung ika'y mag-iiba
Ako'y mangangamba
Dahil ikaw, ikaw ang buhay ko

[Chorus]

Mula ngayon at kailanman
Ang puso ko ay sa iyo lamang
Isa man sa ating mawala
Mayron ala-ala
Hahawakan sa muling pagkikita

"""Trying""",Kim Chiu,"""Gwa Ay Di""","

I've finally know what the meaning of love is
I've finally know how it will end
I've finally know when to make decisions
I've finally know how to control

But the weird thing that I'm feeling
Is not the same
And I don't know what I'm feeling
And I don't know how it remains

And I'm trying to do my best, do my best for you
And I'm trying to be myself, be myself for you
Oh it's just hard to love but the love is strong
I just can't feel the love and I feel that it's not wrong
I'm trying to do my best, do my best
Just to love you

I saw you with someone and it's hard to explain
To explain the feeling that can't go away
It's hard to forget what you did to me
I don't really know what my feeling should be

But the weird thing that I'm feeling
Is not the same
And I don't know what I'm feeling
And I don't know how it remains

And I'm trying to do my best, do my best for you
And I'm trying to be myself, be myself for you
Oh it's just hard to love but the love is strong
I just can't feel the love and I feel that it's not wrong
I'm trying to do my best, do my best
Just to love you, love you

I finally know what the meaning of love is...

"""Heartbreak Song""",Kim Chiu,"""Gwa Ay Di""","

Bakit kaya ganito aking nadarama
Nasasaktan, nang hindi naman nalalaman
Kung meron man akong hiling
Sa puso kong ito
Hindi sana'y hindi sa tulad mo

Gulong gulo ang isip ko
Sa puso kong ito
Hindi alam kung bakit ba
Ikaw ang minahal
Kung kaya ko lang sanang pigilan
Ang aking pusong,
Piliin ka para ibigin ko

Pag ibig ba ay sadyang di maintindihan
Puso't isipan ay hindi rin magkasunduan
Kung kaya kong, limutin ka
Ay ginawa ko na
Ano bang meron ka't mahal kita

Gulong gulo ang isip ko
Sa puso kong ito
Hindi alam kung bakit ba
Ikaw ang minahal
Kung kaya ko lang sanang pigilan
Abng aking pusong,
Piliin ka para ibigin ko

Gulong gulo ang isip ko

What is this I'm feeling
I just can't explain
When you're near,
I'm just not the same
I try to hide it
Try not to show it
It's crazy
How could it be?

I've fallen for you
Finally my heart gave in
And I've fallen in love
I finally know how it feels

[Gerald:]
When you said hello
I look in your eyes
Suddenly I felt good inside
Is this really happen
Or am I just dreamin'
I guess it's true
I can't belive

I've fallen for you
Finally my heart gave in
And I've fallen in love
I finally know how it feels
So this is love

Doesn't matter where I am

Thoughts of you still linger in my mind

No matter what time of day
I've really really fallen for you

I finally know how it feels

"""Mr. Right""",Kim Chiu,"""Chinita Princess""","

Isang araw na di' handa
Naglaro ang tadhana
Nang ika'y makita
Mata natin ay nagtugma
Puso ko may kulang, napuno nalang bigla
Bakit kaya? Pagibig na kaya?

Hindi ko mapigilan ang aking nadarama
Pag ika'y kasama, ang pangit ay gumaganda
Sabi nga nila, kung tunay na ang pagsinta
Mala pelikula, happy ending pa

Ikaw nga ba si Mr. Right?
Ikaw nga ba love of my life?
Ikaw nga ba ang icing sa ibabaw ng cupcake ko?
Ikaw nga ba si Mr. Right? (Mr. Right)
Ikaw nga ba love of my life? (Of my life?)
Ikaw nga ba magbabalik ngiti sa'king mga mata
Si Mr. Right ka ba?
Mr. Right na ba? Mr. Right ka ba?

Kahit na malabo, di alam sa'n tutungo
Pero di' ipagkakait ang hinihiling ng puso ko
Matagal narin naghihintay, tumibok ang puso ko
O sana nga, si Mr. Right ka na

Ikaw nga ba si Mr. Right?
Ikaw nga ba love of my life?

Nahuhulog ang puso kong lito

Pero mahal na mahal kita
At mahal na mahal ko siya
Hindi ko alam ano ang gagawin
Bakit ang puso kong ito
Hirap at litong-lito

"""Fall For Me""",Kyle Echarri,"""It's Me, Kyle""","

I remember the night when our eyes met
I felt it instantly
You were sitting there in front
And I was right behind

Our blank faces, awkward stares
I felt it perfectly
I could almost see
What this is all about

And I couldn't even speak
I felt it and
You got me so weak in the knees

You and me, could be
A perfect melody
If you could see, through me
I'd catch you if you fall

I'm falling in, too deep
I swear I'm yours to keep
And all I could do is to sit and watch
As you fall for me

I can't shake this feeling
But seeing is believing
A love worth fighting for
Just an attempt to land ashore

A picture perfect of scenery
Lines memorized so easily
A spark is waiting to happen
It's all up to you

And I couldn't even speak
I felt it and
You got me so weak in the knees

You and me, could be
A perfect melody
If you could see, through me
I'd catch you if you fall

I'm falling in, too deep
I swear I'm yours to keep
And all I could do is to sit and watch
As you fall for me

It's all I've been asking
It's all I've been trying so hard
For just a little bit of you and me
Of you and me

It's all I've been asking
It's all I've been trying

You and me, could be
A perfect melody
If you could see, through me
I'd catch you if you fall

I'm falling in, too deep
I swear I'm yours to keep
And all I could do is to sit and watch
As you fall for me

You and me, could be

Cause there's a world outside

But I don't care 'bout
Anything but you and me
And all the things that we could be
And I don't know much about where I'll be
Cause I don't care about anything, about anything but you and me

Your my one way flight
To a place I've only been while sleeping
A stellar paradise, we won't need a mask
If you breathe with me
Under a sky of diamonds falling
Lost in the lights and I don't care

About anything but you and me
And all the things that we could be

At talagang walang makakapigil

Filipina Kailangan kita
Kung alam mo lang mahal na mahal kita
Ibibigay ko ang lahat sayo

Hindi ko mapigilan aking nadarama
Sa tuwing ikaw ay nakikita
Ako ay nahuhulog parin
Di ko maiwasan tumingin sa iyong liwanag
Tuwing ako'y nalulungkot ikaw ang aking hinahanap
Kahit sa dami ng babae sa buong mundo
Ikaw ang tanging hinahanap ng puso ko
Di ko na kailangan maghanap ng iba
Tayo hanggang dulo
Sigurado na ako sayo ang aking puso
Sinabi ko naman sayo Lilipad na sa kalawakan
Kahit na anong gawin
Ika'y aking mahal
Ipapangako ko sayo lahat ng gagawin ko ay para Lang sayo

I'm lost in paradise, you will see it in my eyes
Come rescue me
'Cause I need you here with me

Lost in paradise
Lost in paradise

You gave me your love
You gave me your sweet lil' lips
You showed me everything I need
A 'lil girl liking you
Last fragrant flowers, dining with candles
Kissing and talking every night, is all we did
I wish it will never end, with all the love we shared
Wishing those memories will last forever

And now I see, what you're doing to me
And I start to cry, just like listening to a sad lullaby
You left me all alone, I feel foolish I'd have known
What's this all about
Don't know what to do, o babe but still I love you
And I know inside my mind, how I wish that you will always be there

I'm lost in paradise you will see it in my eyes
Come rescue me
'Cause I need you here with me

I still remember, that you will always be there
You'd stay here with me, till the river runs dry

Para lang, sayo ang damdaming ko itong
Bakit pa ako'y iniwan mo

Ba't ngayoy wala ka na sa paningin
Mundo ko ay halos magdilim
Hanap ka palagi ng puso
Paglayo mo sa kin di mo napapansin
Kay bigat nito, bakit wala ka pa mahal ko

Makakaya ko kayang limutin ka
Pag ang luha, sa mata'y tumigil na
Ngunit pag naaalala ka, para bang kay hirap na
O kay hirap na

Ba't ngayoy wala ka na sa paningin
Mundo ko ay halos magdilim
Hanap ka palagi ng puso
Paglayo mo sa kin di mo napapansin
Kay bigat nito, bakit wala ka pa mahal ko

Boy I know just how you feel
You wish it would be real
But you try to fool around
So what's the deal now
Boy I gave you what you need
But you got no time to give
I got to tell you this
Boy can you leave now

I, I never wanna talk to you
Conversation kills my day
There's nothing that you can do
To change my mind now
I, I never wanna talk to you
Conversation kills my day
There's nothing that you can do
To change my mind so

Hold me close
And I will remind you
All the pain and love
That we've gone through
But all this time
All I did was to hate you
I will let you go
I will let you go
[x2]

Boy try to open up your mind
All I did was treat you right
You're not there to hold me tight
How do you feel now?
Boy it's my time to walk away
And I'll find another day
To cure this pain inside
I need to leave this now

I, I never wanna talk to you
Conversation kills my day
There's nothing that you can do
To change my mind now

We use to laugh in the pouring rain
Out in your corner everyday
A thousand smiles can't hide the pain
Can you give me, give me more love
You never seem to satisfy
Can't help but wonder why
Why you lie to me everyday
I just want you, want you to fly

How can I lift you up
When you're the one who's bringing me down
How can I sacrifice in your life
I'm no one

I'm on the run hiding from you
You wont find me I know what to do
Under the sun thinking of you
I hate to love you
I love to hate you

I used to call you on the phone
Every time I feel alone
You never leave me on my own
That makes me
Makes me feel all right
Now you say you don't understand
Everything that I have done
All I want is peace of mind
Can you give me, give me more time

How can I lift you up

You led me to believe
That what we have was made to be
Your conclusions, they came too soon
(Don't get me wrong cause I don't wanna blame you)
It was just cause my heart was unprepared
(For this drama, this hell in my head)
Can't digest your reasons for letting go
It's just not fair how love can turn so cold

Here I stand in front of you
Naked as can be and my heart so true
Look me in the eye and hold my hand
Tell me if you really love me
Now after all that we've been through
The heartaches, the pain, the laughter too
Is the love still burning?
Is the love still burning?

I can't pretend, can't escape cause I'm not content
I hold on to moments built on trust
Emotions making me weak to overcome you is killing me

There was an empty void inside my heart
I tried to fill the space with anything
But left it in the dark
Then a blessing came in the form of you
Now I know that God has smiled on me too

Across the night-time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear his voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the night-time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature

Noong di ka pa nakikita
Akala ko'y nasa kin na ang lahat, di pala
Muntik nang sa iba ay mahulog
Hindi pa pala ako handang umibig

Buti na lang ikaw ay nakilala
Kung di pa, di ko alam ang maaaring mangyari
Kung iba ang napili
Buti ay dumating ka, dahil kung hindi

Ang ligaya kong nadarama, muntik nang hindi mapasa 'kin sinta
Ang init ng 'yong yakap, sa twing kapiling ka
Pag-ibig mong tunay sa iba'y di nakikita
Buti na lang ikaw ang nakasama sa buhay, 'di mawawalay sa 'yo?

Sa 'kin kay raming nagsabing sila ang piliin
Ngunit karamiha'y bitin
Di ko makita sa kanila ang aking hinahanap
Parang laging kulang

Buti na lang ikaw ay nakilala
Kung di pa, di ko alam ang maaaring mangyari
Kung iba ang napili
Buti ay dumating ka, dahil kung hindi

Ang ligaya kong nadarama, muntik nang hindi mapasa 'kin sinta

Pag-ibig mong tunay sa iba'y di nakikita
Buti na lang ikaw ang nakasama sa buhay, 'di mawawalay sa 'yo?

Ikaw na nga
Wala na ngang iba 'kong nakikitang ipapalit pa
Pagka't ikaw lamang sa akin
Ang nagbigay ng tunay na ligaya
O aking sinta

If ever you wondered if you touched my soul, yes you do
Since I met you I'm not the same
You bring life to everything I do
Just the way you said hello
With one touch I can't let go
Never thought I'd fall in love with you

Because of you, my life has changed
Thank you for the love and joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you

Sometimes I get lonely and all I gotta do is think of you
You captured something inside of me
You make all my dreams come true
It's not enough that you love me for me
You reached inside and touched me internally
I love you best explains how I feel for you

Because of you, my life has changed
Thank you for the love and joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you
My life has changed
Thank you for the love and joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you

The magic in your eyes
True love I can't deny
When you hold me I just lose control
I want you to know that I'm never letting go
You mean so much to me, I want the world to see
It's because of you

Because of you, my life has changed
Thank you for the love and joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you
My life has changed
Thank you for the love and joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you

There was a time when I thought life was over and out
When you went away from me
My dying heart made it hard to breathe
Would sit in my room
Because I didn't want to have to go out
And see you walking by
One look and I'd break night down and cry

Now you say that you've made a big mistake
Never meant to take your love away
But you can save your tired apologies
'Cause it may seem hard to believe but

I'm doin' just fine
Getting along very well
Without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind

You were my earth
My number one priority
I gave my love to only you
Anything you'd ask of me I would do
But somewhere down the road
You felt a change in the weather
And told me that you had to journey on
A kiss in the wind and you love was gone

Now you say you never meant to play your games
Boy, don't you know it's far too late
Because you let our love just fall apart
You no longer have a heart

When you said goodbye
I felt so all alone
There were time at night I couldn't sleep
My heart was much to weak to make it on my own
Baby after all the misery
And pain you out me through
So unfair to me boy
You're no longer my world
And I ain't missin' you at all

And you're out hanging with your friends
So you say
Somehow I know it's not quite that way
It's getting pretty late
And you haven't checked on me all day
When I called you didn't answer
Now I'm feeling like you're ignoring me

I wish that you were home
Holding me tight in your arms
And I wish I could go back
To the day before we met
And skip my regret

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No you don't deserve me
Wasting my time thinking 'bout you
When you ain't never gonna change
I wish I wasn't in love with you

(And everything you did wrong I forgive)
So you play me and take advantage
Of the love that I feel for you
Why you wanna hurt me so bad

Belonged to our chemistry
In a world so far away form here
Created by dreams

You made my earth move
Brought sunshine through your smile
Tell me what am I to do
You never warned me about
All the hurt I'd go through for you

Listen, can you still
Hear the love we made
Softly, gently
To the music we played
As you showed me the way

You made my earth move
Brought sunshine through your smile
Tell me what am I to do
You never warned me about
All the hurt I'd go through for you

And now I'm all alone
Abandoned by the only dream
I'd never ever really known...
I'm slowly breaking down

Our world, our home
Burned by reality
Warmed turned stone cold
As darkness appears
And life's taken from me

Brought sunshine through your smile
Tell me what am I to do
You never warned me about

So, why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I find, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you

Been a long time since you called me
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away?
Everything stays the same
I just can't do it, baby
What will it take to make you come back?
Boy, I told you what it is and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me?
You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

Baby, why can't we just start all over again?
Get it back to the way it was
If you give me a chance I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I find, it just ain't true

Are you that afraid of me?

Baby, I will wait for you

Don't tell me I ran out of time

"""Somewhere Over The Rainbow""",Kyla,"""Heartfelt""","

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I heard of once, once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream, they really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

(Somewhere over the rainbow)

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops

Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh, why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why can't I?

You'll remember one day

For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there

"""Someone""",Kyla,"""Heartfelt""","

So long I've waited for a chance
To talk about our circumstance
That seems to run straight to you
And sends my mind
On a roller coaster ride

So tell me if I'm wastin' time
'Cause I'm goin' out my mind
Your tellin' me that this is home
But I need to know

If it wasn't for the problems would you still be with me
If she wanted to start over would you get up and leave
If you had an option boy would you be
With someone, someone, someone else

Please be honest
Be straight up
Just let me know
Was I your rebound on a low
A crutch, a step, a stool for you
The one to help you get through

If you wanted someone else
Would you be afraid to tell
Would you just stick around
Would things still work out in the end

If it wasn't for the problems would you still be with me
If she wanted to star over would you get up and leave
If you had an option boy would you be
With someone, someone, someone else
Is it my imagination or is what I'm feelin' true
If you could have your way would it be mine, just me and you
If you had an option boy would you be
With someone, someone, someone else

I often think about it
How life would really be
If you would have the trust would you be here with me
Or else would it be over, would you stand by me
Love has no guarantees but keep it real with me

If it wasn't for the problems would you still be with me
If she wanted to start over would you get up and leave
If you had an option boy would you be
With someone, someone, someone else
Is it my imagination or is what I'm feelin' true

How could I be so blind, to give up love for the very first time
To be fooled is a hurting pain, to be loved and fooled is a crying shame
While I bear the blame as he laughs my name

"""My Grown Up Christmas List""",Kyla,"""Heart 2 Heart""","

Do you remember me?
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well, I'm all grown up now
Can you still help somehow?
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for the world in need

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And every man would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown up Christmas list

May kindness rules our lives
Not just the strong survive
Sweet tears for all the thousand years on mind
This is the world I pray
We will all share some day
Help me begin by reaching out my hand

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And every man would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown up Christmas list

What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And every man would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my grown up Christmas list, Christmas list

This is a special moment, no one is invited
Only the two of us can play this game
This is a love affair, this night for two
We're all alone now, it's just me and you

One look in the eye can change the mood
A touch with your hand is a daring move
Sound of soft music can make us do the groove
Laughter can turn into a smile
Beating of hearts can [?] the minds
And we can go on and on
Until the break of dawn

This is a private, private affair
Private, private affair
This is a private, private affair
And no one else is gonna be here

This is a perfect moment we can share together
No one in the world can see us now
We'll wait for the moon to chill the night
So we can keep each other warm til the break of light

If only I can try
But to say my last goodbye
Can't even let you go
Understanding things I just don't know
If only I can see
To see the things you see in me
We don't really hold the time
Do our lives really just don't rhyme?

And everytime I see you're smiling face
Wrapping my arms around myself like a warm embrace

And tonight when I dream of the love I really never had
I could try to deny that I'm really really just playing sad
And to say that today
That I'm taking things as they may
And tell myself to just keep the faith

If only I can just hold on from tonight until dawn
Can't really let you go
Understanding things I just don't know
If only I can hide
Hide this pain I have inside
Don't really hold the time
Do our lives really just don't rhyme?

And everytime you always pass me by
Loneliness comes over me but I refuse to die

Mmh, my baby, my mind just keeps on drifting back to you it's true
'Cause by your side is where I just wanna be
Mmh, my baby, my baby, mmh

Not really sure if it's right or wrong to be with you
My baby, your loving makes me crazy, oh it feels like a natural high
Just wanna be around you all the time
Should I pursue my love for you, baby

Didn't know that I could need someone this much
So please tell me now, show me, how, how you feel me there inside
Didn't know I would need someone this bad if it is a crime
I wouldn't mind if it feels like drifting to another place in time

Talk about us, my love, baby
Let's talk about us and trust, ooh, ooh
Let's talk about us, my love, ooh-ooh-ooh, ha

It's been a while since I held your hand in mine, hm
My baby, I miss the way your loving, how it felt like a natural high
Wish I could still be with you all the time
Oh how I love you my baby, whoa-whoa-whoa

Every now and then I try to wipe my memories of you
But I can't conceal it every time I'm thinking of you
Every time I'm dreaming of you, baby no
If you call me then I would just be right there
Coming back to you (coming back to you)

Please no more fantasies, I want you here with me
Baby all I really need is for you to come back here with me
Oh put your hand in mine
Come on please, time to just leave this all behind
I'm one call away (one call away) from coming back right for you, ooh

Don't need more fantasies, I want you here with me
Baby all I really need is for you to come back here with me
Oh put your hand in mine, and I will never leave this all behind
Oh, my heart won't let me forget you

Whoa, let's run away
I don't wanna wait for some day

Five years of us tending scars

Stood by my promise to you

Tired of the show

To find a way to understand

I'm hoping to work it out
And I know that I can
But I need you

I've been a fool
Who said I can do it all alone
How many good friends have I already lost
How many dark nights have I known
Walking down that wrong road
There was nothing I could find
All those years of darkness
Can make a person blind
But now I can see

I am changing
Trying every way I can

All over again, oh

I know it's gonna work out this time
'Cause this time I am

I get my life together now

I'm gonna leave my past behind
I'll change my life

And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
The way that your fingers run through my hair
And how your scent lingers even when you're not here

And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
And how you enjoy your two-hour bath
And how you've convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching like we were insane

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul so completely
I love the way you love me

And I like the sound of old R 'n' B
And you roll your eyes when I'm sloppily off key
And I like the innocent way that you cry
At sappy old movies you've seen thousands of times

And I could list a million things
I love to like about you
But they could all come down to one reason
I could never live without you

Don't be too concerned

Tell me where else can I turn
Because you're the one that I depend upon

No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way this story goes
You always smile...
But in you eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrows
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
Can't live
If living is without you
Can't give

Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moons bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we, should we couldn't we
I'm not sure cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes...

And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our empty sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile

Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us

I wake up and I can't help but want you
As I stare at you, you're lying there asleep
As I'm caressing you I lean over to kiss you
And then you open your eyes you're staring back at me

And then you smile at me
Nothing ever beats the feeling when you kiss me
Nothing in the whole world can replace this feeling
When I look in your eyes I feel so alive, baby
Don't you ever leave my side

You left for work and you leave me there to miss you
You were moving so fast you forgot to say goodbye
And now I'm all alone in your condo
Now I'm seeing till the sun goes down
I already miss your face, I'm so sad without you, babe

And then you call me
There's nothing I would rather hear than your voice speaking
Even if you ain't seen the page just to hear you breathing
You should know by now you're everything my queen
You're my queen

And I know sometimes we'll fuzz and fight
And I might think that I'm always right
Were to proud and were getting out of line
I said some things and now you're crying there
I'm saying sorry but you just don't care
And now it seems you don't want me in your life

And then you hold me
Nothing ever felt so pure than you're sweet loving
Oh, nothing in this whole world can replace this feeling
That you give me, girl, you're my queen

Holding my pillow tight

Don't ever let it go

Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be?
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
""How did love slip away?""
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone

Alone, alone
Why, alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Askin' me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayer
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you

"""Anong Gusto Mo""",Kris Lawrence,No Album,"

Hard to keep it real in a system
So many distractions now
Girl, put down your phone what you missin'
Think it's time to figure out
The things that make you smile
Cuz it seems it's been a while
Since you felt it, right now...

Oh my god, girl, you need love
I can give you some
I can break you off
And it won't stop
Give it all night
You know what's up

I ain't tryin' flex I want your time, time
We don't know each other yet, but give it time, time
I can come through tonight and change your life, life
There ain't no pressure, baby
Lahat ng gusto mo ibibigay ko
Oh oh ooh, ano bang gusto mo
Oh oh ooh

Aye!
You know it's gonna be something, babe
Let me eat and we can conversate
Ain't no need to be afraid
Let me give you some piece of mind
Only if it's okay
We can throw it back like it's thursday
Girl, I'm wanting ya in the worst way
Right now

And it won't stop, give it all night
You know what's up

Hear me out paparamdam ko sayo if its ok with you with you

It's the king and the prince and the artist from the ghetto
Hello, hello, hello!
Bae ko'y natural walang v. belo

Ganyan magmahal ang musikero
Lagi kang 'paglalaban walang bola parang jordan na zero-zero
Kahit sabihan pang ""habogero""
Noong omoo ka, sambit ko'y wag ka ng pumero-pero
Dahil ang pag-ibig ay walang kondisyon
Ambisyon ko'y habambuhay tayong may koneksyon
At dereksyon ko'y matuwid na para bang erection
Ikaw ang enerhiya ko, ako naman ang yon mosyon

Ni minsan may hindi ko sya pwinersa
Panatag sa piling nya na para bang nagsiesta
Biyaya sa itaas naming kinokolekta
Pasensya'y humahaba dahil sa kanyang presensya
Ni minsan may hindi ko sya pwinersa
Panatag sa piling nya na para bang nagsiesta
Biyaya sa itaas naming kinokolekta

Pag-ibig koy tapat meron lisensya
Kung si Kristo to ikaw na ang Iglesya
At ang templo mo ay sagrado hiding-hindi ko hahayaang madepress ka
Makita ko lang na ngumiti ka, para sakin ay yun ay sapat na
Makita ko lang na ngumiti sya, yun ay sapat na

To the fullest, what! what!
The original, lyrical, miracle on your stereo
Stackin' that paper like my work was clerical
I'm handlin' my business
I'm buildin', I'm winnin'
I'm chillin' like a villian
I'm sinnin' but thank you Lord for forgiving me
It's stuck in me
If I was dead broke would you still love me?

"""It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas""",Kris Lawrence,No Album,"

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten, it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes that glow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that'll make 'em ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of Hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

It's starting to feel more and more
Like Christmas

The stars are brightly shining
It is the night
Of our dear Savior's birth

Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Till He appeared
And the soul felt it's worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night when Christ was born
Oh, night divine
Oh night, oh night divine

Truly he taught us to love one another
His law is love and his gospel is peace
Change shall he break for the slave is our brother
And in his name all the pressure shall seize

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus rays be
Let all within us praise his holy name
Christ is Lord
O praise his name forever
His pride and glory ever more proclaim
His power and glory ever more proclaim

Woah, fall on your knees!
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night when Christ was born

"""Within""",Kris Lawrence,No Album,"

The eyes can't hide
What's running through the mind
When love begins to die
It yields the tears we cry

Behind the smile
Could be a struggling lie
And though we try so hard
We just can't fake it

But why do we allow somebody to step in
Though they can't read between the lines when we are hurting?

I don't want to cry aloud
I want him to be the one to know
That I'm in pain
And he's the one to blame
I want him to figure out
It's all about discerning what is real
What I truly feel
To see the meaning knowing what's within

He holds my hand
But never understands
Never understands
Embracing me in coldness
He's too numb to feel

If I convey
The things I have to say
I think you'll only make a fool of myself

But why do we allow somebody to step in
Though they can't read between the lines when we are hurting?

I don't want to cry aloud
I want him to be the one to know
That I'm in pain
And he's the one to blame
Am I the one to blame?
I want him to figure out
It's all about discerning what is real
What I truly feel
To see the meaning knowing what's within

When he starts to see
These tears inside of me
Then I'll believe
That he perceives
Just what's within
What's within
What's within
What's within

I don't want to cry aloud
I want him to be the one to know
That I'm in pain
Sure in pain
And he's the one to blame
And I'm the one to blame
I want him to figure out
It's all about discerning what is real
What I truly feel
To see the meaning knowing what's within

What's within

I bet you spend more time and energy counting sheep
To refuse is not unkind but you might regret this opportunity

Groom coming along within a twinkle of an eye
Death is swallowed up in victory
On where is your sting cause we were meant to be
We were meant to be a witness

True love waits with enough oil to keep their burning lamps

Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

Hmmm ba ba ba ba
Ba ra ra ba ba ba ba ba ba
No, no, no
This isn't the first song, 'cause
Ladies and gentlemen this is just the introduction

There came a time when I almost accepted that music isn't really for me
I know that if I wasn't gonna be able to hit those high notes again
There is nowhere for me to go
I thought I was ready to let all my aspirations of becoming a musician go
But every particle of my tiny body just seemed to repel the idea
My heart knew I was lying to myself
Because music will always be what's gonna keep it beating
What I thought would be the reason for forgetting my dreams
Would've become the very reason, why I have found my identity
I thought my throat condition limited me
But it actually pushed me to be more than what I thought I was
I became in touch with the part of my life that I did not know existed
So I started listening to a lot of artists who challenged me understanding of music
And I started singing music in a new light, in a different perspective
I began to think not just outside of the box, but think like there was never a box

Now here I am today

Sa kulungan nagmustulang, bihag ng 'yong kasakiman
Paniniwala na sinasampay, gumagapos sa'king kamay

Ako'y umibig ng tapat sa isang makinis ang balat
Tindig kisig kanyang tangkad, laging namamangha ang lahat
Buhok n'ya na kulay ginto, kilig na 'di humihinto
Parang kalsadang lumiko mga pangarap ko'y bigo

Sa kulungan nagmustulang, bihag ng 'yong karangyaan
Kaunlarang kanyang alay, gumagapos sa'king kamay

Pananakit na madalas, pisngi na may pasa't gasgas
Mga mata na kay singkit tila ba nakapikit
Latay mula sa hagupit, lagi na lang nakapiit

akala ko din noong una
malabo mangyari
pero tama pala sila
sa simula lang talaga
mahihigpit ang yakap
matatamis ang halik
pagkatapos ng ilang taon
nagsawa ka rin

kahit anong pilit itago
ramdam na ramdam ko pa rin
at kahit anong pilit ikubli
pansin na pansin ko pa rin

hindi naman siguro
kulang ang binigauy
malamang nga naging problema ko ay
binigay ay sobra sobra
kaya ngayon wala nang sakin ay natira
wala na akong maibibigay pa

kahit anong pilit itago
ramdam na ramdam ko pa rin
at kahit anong pilit ikubli
pansin na pansin ko pa rin

nandiyan nga siya
pero wala naman
kahawak mo nga siya
pero wala naman
wala na yung kakilala ko sa simula

ngayon, ang mahigpit na yakap
ay yakap na lang
at ang matamis na halik
ay halik na lang

Kay rami bang nagpapalipad sa hangin
Ngunit ni isa, walang kasing katulad mo
Kung tumama tingin sa akin, pa'no sasabihin?
Pagkakataon ay 'wag palipasin
Ikaw ay aking paiibigin, ohh

Tila may bumubulong sa damdamin, ohh
Ako'y sa'yo, para sa'yo
Ikaw lang talaga'ng panaginip
Doon ako'y samahan mo
Habang puso ko ay umaawit
Sa'yo, sa'yo, sa'yo

Masyado na ba akong nahahalata?
Obvious na obvious, natataranta
Pinagpapawisan at nakanganga
'Di makatitig sa'yong mga mata
Don't you wanna know me though?
Not much of a Romeo
'Di kita matanong nang maayos
Baluktot pa kasi mag-Tagalog
I wanna take you out of movie days
Just choose a day, but not choose today
Sky's going up but you and me
So let's go do whatever suites your taste
Malinis naman ang intensyon ko
But if I act too nice, baka i-friendzone mo, haha
Tamang diskarte (For real), 'wag kang maarte

Sana'y sabihin mo, kung gusto mong sagutin
Ang tanong, 'wag lang sa tingin
Woah, 'wag kang matulala
Dali na lumapit ka sa akin, dalian mo na
Sa'king tabi ikaw ay sumabay (Kanina para sumabay)
Sulyap mo'y nahahalata
Mata mo ay parang nababalisa
Damang-dama ang ibig mong sabihin
Subukan mo kaya kung pwede sa akin 'pagkat
Sagutin kita ng tama
'Pag nalaman ay baka hindi mo na makaya
Gusto pa man din kita
Lumapit ka na dito, chance mo na

Ikaw lang talaga'ng panaginip
Doon ako'y samahan mo
Habang puso ko ay umaawit
Sa'yo, sa'yo, sa'yo
Ikaw lang talaga'ng panaginip
Doon ako'y samahan mo
Habang puso ko ay umaawit

Wake up, baby, talk to me

Somethings on your mind middle of the night
Better let it out

Better make it right tonight

Cause nobody knows what a minute holds

I'm not holding on about to let go
You better speak yourself because you're running out of time

The kind that's once a lifetime,
I feel like on a high
Like my tummy's filled with butterflies,
I've been waiting for this day
A long wait, but it's worthwhile
Can't wait to finally say,
Only hellos, no more goodbyes,

Open up the curtains,
Coz I'm walking down the aisle
I might be running coz I'm certain,
It's the beginning
Of the rest of our lives

Knees are shaking, love, not gonna lie
But no, I can't deny, getting hitched has
Got me super psyched, yeah
Coz walking through that door is the woman I've been praying for
And as I look you in the eye
Today my best friend is gonna be my wife

Open up the curtains,

Na ibalik pa ang kahapon
Nung kasama ko siya

Tapusin ko na itong paghihirap ko
Mahirap harapin ang panahon kung wala na siya talaga sakin
Hindi ko na kaya yon
Kailangan ko yung pag-ibig na ibig ibigay noon
Yung mga araw na may araw pa akong nakikita
Bago nawala ang liwanag sa aking kapaligiran
Bago pa nangyari na bumagsak ang aking mundo
Bago nawasak ang lahat ng mga pinapangarap ko
Di ko na yata talaga kaya manatiling ganito
Naubusan nako ng luha umiiyak ng dugo
At kahit masama sana maunawaan mo po
Ayoko lang na masaktan sa tuwing maaalala ko

Nung ako ay masaya

Nung ako ay masaya

May oras kailangang na maghiwalay
Puso'y lumaban man, walang magagawa
Saan ka, kailan ka muling mahahagkan

Magkulang man sa 'tin itong sandali
Alam ko na tayo'y magkikitang muli
Hangga't may umaga pa na haharapin
Ikaw lang ang mamahalin

Nanahimik ako dito, nagkakape naka de-kwatro
Ilang linggo ng nasa kwarto
Pinto'y naka sarado't, said na ang luha ko
'Di mo ba nakikita? Tapos na ang kabanata
Pagbukas ng bintana, nakadungaw mga tala
Lungkot ay lumisan na
Kung usapang seryoso ang kailangan mo
Pasensya na't 'di ko maibibigay
'Wag magmakaawa wala kang mapapala
Wala na 'kong balak magbalik at lumuha

Imposible, imposible
Sa pelikula lang yan nangyayari
Ang simple, ganun lang kasimple
Hinding-hindi mabubura ang nangyari
Parang ayoko na
Ayoko na ata, ayoko na nga
Ayoko na ata, ayoko na nga
Ayoko na ata, ayoko na nga sa'yo...
Imposible, imposible ang hinihiling mo...

Tatlong oras akong sa kanto,
Naghihintay na parang aso
Ilang beses nang nangyari yun
Wala na bang bago? Nagsasayang lang ang oras ko
At nalaman ko, nadulas ang barkada mo
May pinupuntahan ka raw sa may Baclaran
'Wag magmakaawa wala kang mapapala
Wala na 'kong balak magbalik at lumuha

Imposible, imposible

[Shanti Dope:]
Kamusta? Alam kong ayaw mo ko kausapin
Salitang ako't ikaw bulong na lang sa hangin
'Di pa tamang panahon 'to para usisain
Katotohanang hindi na bago sa'yo pag inamin
Sinasalo mo lang ako kahit alam mo
Na 'di ikaw yung babaeng dapat ginaganto
Kaso lang mukhang pagod ka na kakaunawa
Panahon na din yata maalalang 'di na ko bata
Para makipaglaro ng damdamin sa katulad mo
Paglayo na lang ba yung sagot sa pagkukulang ko
Siguro nga hindi pa ko handa tumaya
'Di ka lang maniniwala pag sinabing 'di sadya

Parang wala nang pagkakaunawaan
Walang pagbigayan sa panahong ito, ito, ito
Parang wala nang nagmamahalan
Wala nang ikaw, wala nang tayo

Gawin mong lahat kahit ang bigat

Sariling kapakinabangan lang ba ang talagang nais mo?

Kahit ilang beses pa, magpatawad ka
Tandaan mo na ang pag-ibig 'di lang salita
Patunayan mo 'yan sa lahat, sa kanila
Sa kanya't sa Kanya

Kahit ang dami dami na nagsasabi, ""Wag kang magpaka-martyr! Ano ka isang bayani?""
Wag kang mabahala, isang paalala:
'Di mo kailangan tularan mga masamang halimbawa na 'yan
Mabilis magsawa, kailan naging tama? Nakalimutan nila ata
Napawi sa alaala na para sa pag-ibig
Dapat handa kang magbigay

Where I am supposed to be
Coz I look like I don't belong
And here's where I don't fit in
Don't judge the book by the cover
All my pages are stained but beautiful
An adventure with every chapter
That you turn

I'd go unusual or usual
My choices could be loud or subtle
Coz I'm sure of what really matters

Coz I break the mold
Oh and I don't know what you've been told

Me down, when I get up I turn to gold

Whatever they say I'll do it my way
I'll flip my hair and say
Face any day, do it my way
Just like my hair, my say
Me you can't play, this is my fray
Cause it's my hair, my say

You don't owe explanations
Don't live to meet expectations of the world
Don't need to earn their affirmation

There shouldn't be such a thing as a standard
Beauty's in the eye of the beholder

Magkahalong takot at kaba ang nararamdaman
Sa anino nya'y hindi ako nasisikatan ng araw
Wala akong araw

Sa mga salita pa lamang niya
Kahit na pabulong nakakalatay
Tenga man ay takpan naririnig pa rin
Anim na taon di na ko nasanay

Sa mga salita pa lamang niya
Ako'y pinapasa
Sa mga salita pa lamang niya
Ay kayang kaya niya akong durugin

Sa mga salita...

""Ito ang yong gawin""

Boses na kay dami
Kunwaring may paki

Alam ko naman na
Kaya kay daming nandyan
Yung iba dikit lang

Tayo ay babalik sa simula

Ito na'ng ating unang pahina
Ang hakbang sa pagiging isa
Na pang habang buhay

'Wag mangamba ang pag-ibig ang ating punla
May Kapal ay syang may akda
Sa'ting paglalakbay

Balikan ating dahilan
Pagnakalimutan na ating sayaw
Kumupas dating pagtingin
At kung ang dulo ay natatanaw
Sumpaan ay gunitain
Tayo ay babalik, babalik sa simula

Kung dumating man
Ang unos na dala ng ulan
Lagi mong pakatatandaan
Yakap ko'y silungan

Balikan ating dahilan
Pagnakalimutan na ating sayaw
Kumupas dating pagtingin
At kung ang dulo ay natatanaw
Sumpaan ay gunitain
Tayo ay babalik, babalik sa simula

Kung maliligaw
Ikaw ang linaw
'Di ka bibitawan
Sa sigwa o araw
Dilim o bughaw
Ikaw ang sigaw

"""Somebody Like You""",KZ Tandingan,No Album,"

Used to think I'd always be alone
I would wander in the dark all on my own
Used to believe that I was better off
Built a wall around my heart and let them go

Late nights under street lights
Losing my mind then you found me
You found me
Only for a moment
Got me hoping for eternity
Eternity

Oh I, I thought I'd never find somebody like you
I thought I was alright without anyone new
But it wouldn't be so hard with somebody like you
Somebody like you

Oh I, I thought I didn't care, now I know that I do
Cause something in the air got me thinking it's true
That it wouldn't be so hard with somebody like you
Somebody like you

Somebody like you, you
Somebody like you, you
Somebody like you

Somebody like you

Feel so close but still so far away
Got me replaying your words, just what you said
How your touch still lingers on my face
You got me dreaming of your love, now it feels safe

Late nights under street lights
Losing my mind then you found me
You found me
Only for a moment
Got me hoping for eternity
Eternity

Oh I, I thought I'd never find somebody like you
I thought I was alright without anyone new

"""Tawag Mo""",KZ Tandingan,No Album,"

Nung una 'di ko mapigilan na biglang lumuha
Puso't isip ko'y hindi kasi naniniwala
Ang inakala ko nung una'y madali
Pero masakit 'di na babalik
Ang lahat lahat ng bagay sa ating dalawa

Kanina, kanina, naghihintay
Gusto ng, gusto ng, kasabay
Palaging, palaging, naghihintay
Ng tawag ng tawag ng tawag ng tawag mo

Buong araw akong nakatulala
Naghihintay ng himala
Para bang ako'y nahihibang
Kanina lang, nagbibilang
Kung ilang beses nag-abang ng tawag mo
Hinahanap ang tunog ng tawag mo
(Hinahanap ang tunog ng tawag mo)
Gustong marinig ng mga tenga ko
(Gustong marinig ng mga tenga ko)
Ang tawag mo, ang gustong marinig
Ang boses mong kay ganda bakit ba ayaw mo

Kanina, kanina, naghihintay
Gusto ng, gusto ng, kasabay
Palaging, palaging, naghihintay
Ng tawag ng tawag ng tawag ng tawag mo

Nung tumagal ay natapos din ang pagluha
Puso't isip ko ay tanggap na ang pagkawala
Ang inakala ko nung una'y madali
Pero masakit 'di na babalik
Ang lahat lahat ng bagay sa ating dalawa

Hindi na, hindi na, maghihintay

"""Till My Heartaches End""",KZ Tandingan,No Album,"

I recall when you said that you would never leave me
You told me more, so much more like when the time you whispered in my ear
There was heaven in my heart
I remember when you said that you'd be here forever

Then you left without even saying that you're leaving
I was hurt and it really won't be easy to forget yesterday
And I pray that you would stay
But then you're gone and, oh, so far away

I was afraid this time would come
I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurtin' from within
I have learned to live my life beside you
Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight
And if into my dream you'll come and touch me once again
I'll just keep on dreaming till my heartaches end

And then you left without even saying that you're leaving

"""Two Less Lonely People In The World""",KZ Tandingan,No Album,"

I was down, my dreams were wearing thin
When you're lost, where do you begin?
My heart always seemed to drift from day to day
Looking for the love that never came my way

Then you smiled and I reached out to you
I could tell you were lonely too
One look and then it all began for you and me
The moment that we touched I knew that there would be

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people
In the world tonight

Just to think what I might have missed
Looking back how did I exist
I dreamed, still I never thought I'd come this far
But miracles come true, I know 'cause here we are

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people
In the world tonight

Tonight I fell in love with you
And all the things I never knew
Seemed to come to me somehow
'Cause, baby, love is here and now there's

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people
