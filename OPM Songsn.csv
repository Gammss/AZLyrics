Para-Paraan, Para-Paraan
Para para lang, Para para lang [3x]

Napapatingin, Napapakilig
Madalas sa iyo napapatitig
Tuwing dumadaan, napapagaan
Araw na punong-puno ng kaguluhan

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh hihikain yata ang tinamaang bata
Para lang sa sulyap mo ako'y mamamanata

[Chorus:]
Para-Paraan, Para-Paraan
Para para lang, Para para lang
Makasilay lang, makasilay lang
Makasilay lang sayo
Para-Paraan, Para-Paraan
Para para lang, Para para lang
Makasimple lang, makasimple lang
Makasimple lang sayo

Kinokontyaba na lahat ng kabarkada
Napapansin mo bang dalas makasalubong ka
Kahit na magpigil ako ay nang-gigigil
Ano pa bang magagawa ikaw ay feel na feel

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Ano pa bang magagawa
Para ako`y iyong mapansin
Sana makita mong
Ako`y para sayo
At ika`y para sakin

Ano pa bang magagawa
Para ako`y iyong mapansin
Sana makita mong
Ako`y para sayo
At ika`y para sakin

"""Bahala Na""",Nadine Lustre,"""Nadine Lustre""","

Bahala Na

Na na na na na...
Whoa...
Na na na na na...

Naniniwala na ako sa forever
Magmula nung nakilala kita
Eh kaya nga 'di ako sumu-render
Ano man ang sinasabi nila

Pagkat sa 'yo natagpuan ang ipinagkait sa akin
At sa 'yo naramdaman ang hindi ko akalaing
Ipaglalaban ko

[Chorus:]
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Wala na kong paki basta, bahala na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Alam ko lang kasi minamahal kita
At kahit pa sabihin na
Sa 'kin 'di ka itinadhana
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Mahal kita kasi kaya bahala na

Ikaw yung bida na prinsesa ng drama
Ikaw yung action star na leading man
Parang pelikula 'pag tayo nagsama
Ang umekstra 'di pagbibigyan

Pagkat sa 'yo natagpuan ang ipinagkait sa akin
At sa 'yo naramdaman ang hindi ko akalaing
Ipaglalaban ko

[Repeat Chorus]

Bahala na
Kahit 'di pa tayo ganon ka sigurado
Isusugal ang ating puso bahala na
Kahit may tumutol 'di na mapuputol
Ang pag-ibig ko sa 'yo
Pagkat sa 'yo natagpuan ang ipinagkait sa akin
At sa 'yo naramdaman ang hindi ko akalaing
Ipaglalaban ko
Yeah...

"""Me & You""",Nadine Lustre,"""Nadine Lustre""","

Well I haven't seen you in a while
But I'm still held captive by your smile
Don't you think we deserve another try?
Cause we never really let it go
And your arms still feel like coming home
And maybe we be better off this time?
Lately, my life is like
Keep playing the same day and it never seems to end
But when I look into your eyes you make me feel alive again

Can we disappear?
Can we leave this place?
Can we fly away?
Far away, from here where it's all so new
All we need is me and...
You... ohh... ohhh... ohhh... ohhh...

Do you still remember the first day?
When you turned your head and look my way?
When you crash landed into my heart,
And I always knew that we would be
Finding a way back eventually and this time,
I hope we never part

Lately, my life is like
Keep playing the same day and it never seems to end
But when I look into your eyes,
You make me feel alive again

Can we disappear?
Can we leave this place?
Can we fly away? far away,

Look beyond the bright side (Let go)

Dreams they show me what I can't explain

Wake up and wake up
Windows and walkways
Somewhere I got lost

Familiar faces
Hello can you help?
Maybe they know me
Better than I know myself

Can't control
The forward motion
Caught the current
Lost in the ocean
Paralyzed the fear leaves me frozen
Can't see beyond my emotion
Bright lights there's no end in sight
Runways paved in all eyes
They got me right where they like

Tell me what is real
Stop chasing bad habits
Tell me what is real
Follow the white rabbit

I'm stuck in a dream
They tell me what's real
My love is fading
Look around my castle started caving

Wake up and wake up
Windows & hallways
Somewhere I got lost
Wake up and wake up
Familiar faces
In my world, I am the queen
But even my own reflection keeps judging me

Can't control
The forward motion
Caught the current
Lost in the ocean
Paralyzed the fear leaves me frozen
Can't see beyond my emotion
Bright lights there's no end in sight
Runways paved in all eyes
They got me right where they like

We ain't going out like this
Us against the world we never doubt, don't miss
Switch off the lights
Feels like I'm alone on nights like this
Take flight like this

Letting yourself go has never been a question
Add a lil petrol to the fire, make your head spin
I'm a brand new phoenix
Life's got a brand meaning
Time for redeeming

I know you've been through many things
It's been a minute
Since you felt like you could spread your wings
And now you're in it

Hey there girl I know
You've been too busy crushing every obstacle
No time to take it slow

Tell me what is real
Stop chasing bad habits
Tell me what is real
Follow the white rabbit

Tell me what is real
Stop chasing bad habits
Tell me what is real

Days are moving
Sun is shining
We're just cruising
Falling deep into the water
Live in the moment
We're just starting

I wanna dive
Weightless stuck in time
Close my eyes fall blind
I'm falling

Cause I'm all in

Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling

I'm seeing purple in the sky I fly so high the sun is waving
My heart is racing stuck in time the plants are calling
Calling, calling, calling, calling

I need to breath
Falling deep into the water
Stuck in a dream
Everything I touch is treasure
I see the flowers blooming
Days are moving
Sun is shining
We're just cruising
Falling deep into the water
Live the moment
We're just starting

I wanna dive
Weightless stuck in time
Close my eyes fall blind
I'm falling

Cause I'm all in

I'm seeing purple in the sky I fly so high the sun is waving
My heart is racing stuck in time the plants are calling
Calling, calling, calling, calling

I'm seeing purple in the sky I fly so high the sun is waving

Nakilala kita sa 'di ko inaasahang pagkakakataon
Nakakabigla para bang sinadya at tinakda ng panahon
Tila agad akong nahulog nang hindi napapansin
Pero tadhana ko'y mukhang 'di tayo pagtatagpuin

Pinili kong lumayo
Ngunit pilitin ma'y bumabalik sa'yo
Ikaw pa rin pala ang hanap-hanap parap-pap
Na kahit magpanggap 'di matatago na ang 'yong yakap
Ang hanap-hanap parap-pap-pap
'Di nagbabago ikaw ang hanap-hanap ko

Inakala ko ring ganon kadaling alisin ka sa buhay kong ito
Sinubok umibig ng iba
Pero 'di rin nawala ang pag-ibig ko sa 'yo
Sa tuwing kapiling siya'y ikaw ang nasa isip (nasa isip)
At kahit maging panaginip ma'y ika'y nakapaligid

Even though the rain is gone
I'm a little overgrown
Baby, that's the way it goes
Baby, that's the way it goes

Damn, I was raised by camera flash
Wasn't in it for the trend
I knew I had this dream since I was ten
Wasn't easy, won't pretend
Learned a lot about myself
Lot of scars, can't you tell
I learned to think before I talk
I think I made it
Crying got me going places
Thought I knew the real me, changing with the seasons
Flash, I was saying all my graces
Now, I'm watching the lights go on
And my name rise up, like someone famous (Famous, famous, uh)

Some good, some good things are hard to come by
Stop to smell the flowers and I
Some good, some good things are hard come by
Stop to smell the flowers and I, I-I

Twenty to the top
Twenty somethin' jump
In the deep-end
In the deep-end
Twenty to top
Twenty somethin' dance
With my demons on the weekend

Even though the rain is gone
I'm a little overgrown
Baby, that's the way it goes
Baby, that's the way it goes

All the shit that I said, it was worth it
Little misunderstood, it's a crisis
Wouldn't recognize, me, if I was you
Closed my eyes to see it through
Think I hear him calling in my dreams
Sending me signs
Held me when I needed something divine
Chasing the light

Twenty to the top
Twenty somethin' jump

Oh, I never knew what love was
Till I met you
This feeling seems to grow more everyday
I love you more each day

"""Wait For Me""",Nadine Lustre,No Album,"

I'm already on a red eye flight
Left a note outside your door
Couldn't bear to look into your eyes
See your heart sink right in to the floor

I've gone back and forth a hundred times
Played it over in my head
But there's no easy way to say goodbye
When I'm still tastin' you on my lips

Need a little time to think
You don't gotta wait for me
You can do your own thing
While I do some work on me
I don't wanna make a mess of your love
And I can't be the one that's holding you up
You can do your own thing
You don't gotta wait for me

You can't drink away a memory
And a touch won't wash away
What's meant to be will always be
Leave a crack in the door just in case

Before it all goes up in smoke
Love me hard and let me go
Good things can fall apart
I don't mean mean to break break your heart

Need a little time to think
You don't gotta wait for me
You can do your own thing
While I do some work on me
I don't wanna make a mess of your love
And I can't be the one that's holding you up
You can do your own thing
You don't gotta wait

You don't gotta wait for me, me, me
Wait for me, me
You don't gotta wait
You don't gotta wait for me

I'm already on a red eye flight
Left a note outside your door
Couldn't bear to look into your eyes
No...

Need a little time to think
You don't gotta wait for me
You can do your own thing
While I do some work on me
I don't wanna make a mess of your love
And I can't be the one that's holding you up

Will I close my eyes
Will I hold my breath
Will I want to cry
Will our souls connect
I've been thinkin' about it
When I go to bed at night
I wonder, I wonder

Will you hold my hand
Will you speak of love
Will the stars be shining in the sky above
Will it be all I've been dreaming of for so long
Holdin' on

Our first kiss
Won't be the last
Our love's too deep
To end that fast
And good things come to those who have to wait
I believe it's only time
That keeps us from the thing divine
And when it's here you know
I'm gonna say

Will it taste like candy
Will it be that sweet
Will our hearts be racing to a heavenly beat
Will the moment sweep me off my feet
And draw me under, under

Will I tremble tremble
When I beg for more
Will it be like anything I never felt before
Will we be down for a little more
One thing I know for sure

Our first kiss
Won't be the last
Our love's too deep
To end that fast
And good things come to those who have to wait
I believe it's only time

I can picture it all inside my head
Just how it's going to feel
But a girl can only dream so much
Now she wants to make it real
Make it real

Won't be the last

Never been any good at love
Never could find no one that I dreamed of
I must've been too blind to see 
That you were always there waiting for me

But then the spell was broken, my eyes opened
Starting believing in love again
Just when i gave up on miracles
You rescued me and showed me the way

[CHORUS:]
You must be an angel
Feels like I've gone to heaven 
And it keeps on getting better baby
Caught up in your love spell
Feels like I'm in heaven, heaven

Never thought I'd see the day
A special guy like you would come my way
I wish I knew the reasons why
You gave me the strength for one more try
How could love at first sight
Work out so right
I cant believe this is paradise
Just when I thought love would never come
You came to me swept me away

Suddenly my whole world changes
I found the kind of love that I've been thinking of
I know that dreams come true coz
My heaven is waiting to take me
Take me when I'm with you

Jealous of the girl who caught your eye
One of my darker days
When you looked at her where was I?
Shoulda been in her place

Here I am
All alone imagining
What might have been
What could have been
If I had been there

Jealous of the one whose arms are around you
If she's keeping you satisfied
Jealous of the one who finally found you
Made your sun and your stars collide
La la la la la la la
She's a very very lucky girl
La la la la la la la

Jealous of the girl who won your heart
They say it's a perfect match
She's gonna get to be where you are
And I don't get better than that

She'll say you're fine
Whisper words I wish were mine
What might have been
What could have been
If I had been there

Jealous of the one whose arms are around you
If she's keeping you satisfied
Jealous of the one who finally found you
Made your sun and your stars collide
La la la la la la la
She's a very very lucky girl

And you know I'd fight the good fight
If I thought I'd change your mind
But if she makes you happy
Then I'll leave the dream behind

Man, she better treat you right
And give you everything
'Cause the moment that she doesn't
I'll be waiting in the wind

Somebody will sweep you off your feet some day

I prayed for the day that I would get the chance
And just when I worked up the courage to try
Much to my surprise

You had somebody else
These feelings I keep to myself

I may never get to hold you so tight
I may never get to kiss you goodnight
I may never get to look deep in your eyes 
Or so it seems
I always will be wishing you were mine
I'll think about what could be all the time
All the happiness that I could find
Baby, a girl can dream

From the moment I wake up till I fall asleep
I imaging you're not with her but with me
Talking and laughing sharing our dreams
But it's just a fantasy

I can sense what you've been thinking
You wanna know if what I feel

Does your touch give me chills
If you think I have no interest
In the things you say and do
Baby if you close this distance
I'm gonna prove to you thatÂ

I'm readyÂ readyÂ readyÂboy oh wanna play [?]

Gonna tell you whatcha wanna hear boy

Been thinking bout it lately
And I wanna be your baby
Yes I do, I do, I do

I can see you got some issues
You're afraid to let love start
Many pieces of this puzzle
Are missin from your heart
I can heal the pain your feelin
I can fix the things you fear
Seems too obvious to mention
That you're the reason that I'm here..

We'll lie between the blue and green
Maybe love changes everything
Tears won't wash away the hurt
Runnin from it doesn't work
Cause love changes everything,
Everything, everythingÂ Everything

Locked inside this place
Searchin' for answers
In your arms
Tears run down my face
So much sadness
Is taking over my heart

Don't recognize
The person I
Used to know
Where did he go
Tell me what's
It gonna be
Talk to me

Where is the love
Love is what's been missing for so long
Are we givin in by givin up
Where is love, where is love

Seems like yesterday
We were so close
One heart beating
I wish we could lay
Down our defenses
And start healing

I can see
Such confusion
Got to be
Some solution
People change
And I'm willing
Don't be afraid

Where is the love
Love is what's been missing for so long
Are we givin' in by givin' up
Where is love, where is love

A simple love is what I need
Understanding honesty
It might take a little time
But in my heart I know you'll find love

Where is the love
Love is what's been missing for so long
Are we givin' in by givin' up
Where is love, where is love

Where is the love
Love is what's been missing for so long
Are we givin' in by givin' up
Where is love, where is love

Where is the love
Love is what's been missing for so long
Are we givin' in by givin' up

fluttering.
Dreaming of flying away,
Being scared to fall.

Oh I am hiding for an eager breeze.
That will drag me to the vicious truth.
It will screech into my heart.

But I canât hide forever,
No I got to face the truth.

I got scarves on the outside, but they are not the worst,
itâs more the feeling I canât hide, where I cover myself in.
The grief of being different lets me flown away in tears.

Hear the sob, yeah that was mine, wincing. 
By the thought of laying me down, the switch of the ignorance.

I got scarves on the outside, but they are not the worst,
itâs more the feeling I canât hide, where I cover myself in.
The grief of being different let me flown away in tears.

I wander in the streets and looking doubtful at myself,
suddenly the sadness is hard to fade away
Because I realize I am different, but Iâm the same inside my mind.

I got scarves on the outside, believe theyâre now the worst.

For that day
Till the end
I'm waiting for you till the end

How can I forget the love?
How can I forget the love?

How can I forget
The day you said that
You would never leave me
How can I forget
The love that we shared
It's coming back to my life
Once again

How can I
How can I

How can I forget

"""I Could Not Ask For More""",Nina,No Album,"

Lying here with you
Listening to the rain
Smiling just to see smile upon your face
These are the moments I thank God that I'm alive
These are the moments Iâll remember all my life
I found all Iâve waited for
And I could not ask for more
Looking in your eyes
Seeing all I need
Everything you are is everything to me
These are the moments I know heaven must exist
These are the moments I know all I need is this
I have all Iâve waited for
And I could not ask for more
I could not ask for more than this time together
I could not ask for more than this time with you
Every prayer has been answered
Every dream I haveâs come true
And right here in this moment is right were
Iâm meant to be
Here with you here with me
These are the moments I thank God that Iâm alive 
These are the moments Iâll remember all my life
Iâve got all Iâve waited for
And I could not ask for more
I could not ask for more than this time together
I could not ask for more than this time with you
Every prayer has been answered
Every dream I haveâs come true
And right here in this moment is right were
Iâm meant to be
Here with you here with me
I could not ask for more than the love you
give me âcause itâs all I've waiting for
And I could not ask for more
I could not ask for more...

"""I'll Always Love You""",Nina,No Album,"

Standing by my window, listening for your call
Seems I really miss you after all
Time won't let me keep these sad thoughts to myself
I'd just like to let you know, I wish I'd never let you go

And I'll always love you
Deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you
And I'll always need you
And if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I will love you

I wish you'd never left me but love's a mystery
You can break a heart so easily
Oh the days and nights reveal how much I feel for you
Time has come for me to see how much your love has meant to me

And I'll always love you
And if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I will love you

Time like a river keeps on rolling right on by
Nothing left for me to do
So I watch the river rise

And I'll always love you
Deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you
And I'll always need you
And if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I will
And I'll still, I will love you

"""Love Moves In Mysterious Ways""",Nina,No Album,"

Who'd have thought this is how the pieces fit
You and I shouldn't even try making sense of it
I forgot how we ever came this far
I believe we had reasons but I don't know what they are
Don't blame it on my heart, oh

Love moves in mysterious ways
It's always so surprising
When love appears over the horizon
I'll love you for the rest of my days
But still it's a mystery
How you ever came to me
Which only proves
Love moves in mysterious ways

Heaven knows love is just a chance we take
We make plans but then love demands a leap of faith
So hold me close and never ever let me go
'Cos even though we think we know which way the river flows
That's not the way love goes, no

Love moves in mysterious ways
It's always so surprising
When love appears over the horizon
I'll love you for the rest of my days
But still it's a mystery
How you ever came to me
Which only proves
Love moves in mysterious ways

Like the ticking of a clock two hearts that beat as one
But I'll never understand the way it's done, oh

Love moves in mysterious ways
It's always so surprising
When love appears over the horizon
I'll love you for the rest of my days
But still it's a mystery
How you ever came to me
Which only proves
Love moves in mysterious ways

Love moves in mysterious ways

"""One Little Candle""",Nina,No Album,"

It is better to light just one little candle
Than to stumble in the dark
Better far that you light just one little candle
All you need is a tiny spark

If we all say a prayer, then the world would be free
What a wonderful dawn of a new day we'd see (New day we'd see)
And if everyone lit just one little candle
What a bright world this would be, yeah, yeah

It is better to light just one little candle
Than to stumble in the dark (Stumble in the dark)
Better far that you light just one little candle (One little candle)
All you need is a tiny spark (Tiny spark)

If we all say a prayer, then the world would be free
What a wonderful dawn of a new day we'd see
If everyone lit just one little candle
What a bright world this would be

What a bright world this would be

"""Sniper Gang (Freestyle)""",Nina,No Album,"

Blicky the Blicky, the Blicky, the Blicky, the Blicky
Gang, Gang, Gang
Grrrrrrrrttttt, Bop!
Bop, Bop, Bop!

When I get to swerving on 'em, spinning the curb up on 'em
Sending Suburbans on 'em and we lurking on 'em
Ain't no funeral service for 'em (Boom, boom, boom)
I'm on a mission for 'em, Sniper Gang got the vision on 'em
Never snitching, go to prison for 'em (Nah)
Hundred round drum, thirty clip is on 'em, blood dripping on 'em
Pussy nigga went against the gang, you know that's a violation
Penalty is death, take his last breath
Bullets burning, like I'm frying bacon, niggas dying waiting
Never mind the hating, I'm a General, nigga (Blicky the Blicky)
I'm about to put an end to you niggas
Niggas fucked your baby momma, spent up all your money
All you did was tell on them niggas? (Bands, bands, bands, bands)
You was with this gang banging, you was tryna be like 22
I'm responsible for all you niggas (Blicky the Blicky)
I'm the realest nigga, tell the truth (Bop, bop, bop)
And I know I might alarm you, nobody thinks you a Don Q
Thirty round knocking off a limb, maybe leg, head, plus an arm too
I could look into your eyes, know you never been on a mission
Some niggas be bitch and never really listen
Get put in a ditch and now his momma missing
Might put out that hit and now we gotta get him
We caught us a lick and now we gotta wet 'em
This shit ain't no diss, ain't no Tory Lanez
I pull out that blick and leave no remains
You don't want these Blicky niggas parked inside of Highbridge
Look what I did, got the ladder hanging out the stick
Looking like a high bridge, you could die, kid
Fuck Real Ryte, y'all can suck a dick and get killed too
Y'all know damn well who got y'all mans hit
Even Kooda blood would get spilled too
Killing niggas then I rap about it, like I'm Melly, nigga (Right)
Ain't no shit that you could tell me, nigga (Right)
Murder on my mind, is you ready, nigga, I'm a deadly nigga
Can't compare my shit to none of these bitch niggas
Not JD, not D Sav, and especially not that snitch nigga

Blicky the Blicky, the Blicky, the Blicky, the Blicky, the Blicky
Soft ass niggas
Stop fuckin' calling my name, son (Gang, Gang, Gang)
Y'all niggas don't put in no work, for real though
Y'all don't want us in person
Y'all know how that shit get
On God

Suck my dick
Bitch we roll in threes, two Blicky's shooting and one driver, that's how it's suppose to be
Pussy, you ain't never kill a body, can't get close to me
We gon' keep on flipping, spinning blocks until they all deceased
Invest in a ratchet or a casket (Blicky, the Blicky, the Blicky)
They never be where they suppose to be
I got the heat to control streets (Control the streets)
I bet this dick will control your treesh (Treesh, Treesh)
Couple head shots, gon' expose his dreams
You caught a opp and then flew to Miami (Yeah right)
That nigga lied
All of my opps took a trip to Miami (Pussies)
I wonder why
I'm with them Snipers and Blicky's don't panic (Sniper, Blicky)
Either way niggas die
I just came home, I beat it, don't care to go back
That young nigga wilding (Gang, Gang, Gang)
If the nigga Real-Right, tell the driver bend right
G Herbo get herb too
Post on my pic then delete it, I'll murk you
But shout out to Chiraq, I know where the guys at
Spinning with Rugers, so you better duck
Or they aim where your mind at
Grrrrtttttt, boom!
