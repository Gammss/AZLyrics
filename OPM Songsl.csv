"""Anak""",Lani Misalucha,No Album,"

Noong isilang ka sa mundong ito
Laking tuwa ng magulang mo
At ang kamay nila ang iyong ilaw
At ang nanay at tatay mo'y
Di malaman ang gagawin
Minamasdan pati pagtulog mo
At sa gabi'y napupuyat ang iyong nanay
Sa pagtimpla ng gatas mo
At sa umaga nama'y kalong ka
Ng iyong amang tuwang-tuwa sa iyo
Ngayon nga ay malaki ka na
Nais mo'y maging malaya
Di man sila payag
Walang magagawa
Ikaw nga ay biglang nagbago
Naging matigas ang iyong ulo
At ang payo nila'y sinuway mo
Di mo man lang inisip na
Ang kanilang ginagawa'y para sa iyo
Pagkat ang nais mo'y
Masunod ang layaw mo
Di mo sila pinapansin
Nagdaan pa ang mga araw
At ang landas mo'y naligaw
Ikaw ay nalulong sa masamang bisyo
At ang una mong nilapitan
Ang iyong inang lumuluha
At ang tanong,""anak, ba't ka nagkaganyan""
At ang iyong mga mata'y biglang lumuha ng di mo napapansin
Nagsisisi at sa isip mo'y
Nalaman mong ika'y nagkamali
Nagsisisi at sa isip mo'y
Nalaman mong ika'y nagkamali
Nagsisisi at sa isip mo'y
Nalaman mong ika'y nagkamali...

"""Bayan Kang Magiliw (Awit Sa Ating Bayang Minamahal)""",Lani Misalucha,No Album,"

Bayan kang magiliw sa amin
Kailan pa ma'y hindi magdidilim
Busilak ang dilaw, puti, pula, bughaw
Dama sa 'yong tatlong bituin at araw

Sa dami ng iyong pinagdaanan
Iba't ibang sigwa ang naranasan
Kapit lang sa Dios na may pagtitiwala
Pinagtagumpayan nang mapayapa

Magkaisang tinig, sa panalangin pagpalain
Ang pinakamamahal na lupang hinirang natin
Watawat mo'y itataas, itatanyag, itatanghal
Ang awit sa ating bayang minamahal

Tunay ang pagmamahal sa'yo
Buhay ay langit sa piling mo
Duyan ng magiting ang pumipintig
Lulan ng walang hanggang pag-ibig

Magkaisang tinig, sa panalangin pagpalain
Ang pinakamamahal na lupang hinirang natin
Watawat mo'y itataas, itatanyag, itatanghal
Ang awit sa ating bayang minamahal

Namumukod-tanging pagsinta, sa dibdib mo'y buhay
Walang kasing alab ng pusong binibigyang pugay
Binibigyang pugay

Magkaisang tinig, sa panalangin pagpalain
Ang pinakamamahal na lupang hinirang natin
Watawat mo'y itataas, itatanyag, itatanghal
Ang awit sa ating bayang minamahal

Watawat mo'y itataas, itatanyag, itatanghal
Ang awit sa ating bayang minamahal

Bayan kang magiliw
Bayan kang magiliw sa amin

"""Bukas Na Lang Kita Mamahalin""",Lani Misalucha,No Album,"

Kay hirap palang umibig sa di tamang panahon
Kung bakit ngayon ko lang natagpuan ang isang katulad mo

Sana noon pakita nakilala
Sana noon pa lang na ang puso ay malaya pang magmahal

Bukas nalang kita mamahalin
Sabay sa paglaya ng ating mga puso
Bukas na lang kita mamahalin

Kay hirap pa lang umibig sa di tamang panohon

Bukas nalang kita mamahalin
Sabay sa paglaya ng ating mga puso
Bukas na lang kita
Bukas na lang kita
Bukas na lang kita

"""Grown Up Christmas List""",Lani Misalucha,No Album,"

Do you remember me?
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you
With childhood fantasies

Well I'm all grown up now
Can you still help somehow
I'm not a child
But my heart still can dream

So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself
But for a world in need

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts

And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown up Christmas list

As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely
Wrapped beneath the tree

But heaven surely knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a hurting human soul

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal our hearts

And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list

What is this illusion
Called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief
Can we ever find the truth
Ohhh

No more lives torn apart
(No more torn apart)
That wars would never start
(Never start)
And time would heal all hearts
(Oh, hearts)

Everyone would have a friend
(One would have a friend)
And right would always win
(Would always win)
And love would never end
(Never, never end, no)

This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

"""Healing""",Lani Misalucha,No Album,"

Now that we have gotten through
One more fall
I can just admit I've got it all
Cause I do
Cause I've got you
We've crossed these battle lines to many times
It passes through the heart
But it never leaves a mark

Cause Your love just keeps on healing me
No matter how I bruise
If I just trust You
Your love just keeps on healing me
One more clue
One more chance that wasn't there before
In your arms
No pain can harm the way I'm feeling
Lord I know that Your love is healing

I've kicked around those lines inside my head
But I've never listened to the words that You said
See where it's lead
Well I know I have it now
Cause You showed me how
And all I had to do
Was just to keep my eyes on You

Cause Your love just keeps on healing me
No matter how I bruise
If I just trust You
Your love just keeps on healing me
One more clue
One more chance that wasn't there before
In your arms
No pain can harm the way I'm feeling
Lord I know that Your love is healing

Cause Your love just keeps on healing me
No matter how I bruise
If I just trust You
Your love just keeps on healing me
One more clue
One more chance that wasn't there before
In your arms
No pain can harm the way I'm feeling

Lord I know that Your love is healing

"""I Can't Give Anymore""",Lani Misalucha,No Album,"

I gave my all to you
You took the best of me
I should have left before
I was torn completely
Wondering, can we come back from this?
Wishing I'd get back what we had
All our moments of bliss

I don't want to try
I don't want to write our love story
Another story with an ending that leads nowhere

I can't give anymore
I can't give anymore
Our last petal falls
I lost my life to keep you
I never left your side
But I can't give anymore
What was this for?

You have no remedy
It's all been said and done
It's time we realize this is our setting sun
Here I am, nothing left to prove
I keep tryin' to fight but I still
Can't get through to you

I don't want to try
I don't want to write our love story
Another story with an ending that leads nowhere

I can't give anymore
I can't give anymore
Our last petal falls
I lost my life to keep you
I never left your side
But I can't give anymore

We both can see it
We both can see the end
We both can see it
We both can see the end

Thought I could win, try it again
But the memories keep burning my mind
Hoped I still could but I

I can't give anymore
I can't give anymore
Our last petal falls
I lost my life to keep you
I never left your side
But I can't give anymore
What was this for?

I can't give anymore
What was this for?

At sa pagsapit ng gabi
Nais ko'y nariyan ka sa'king tabi
Minsan lang ako nangarap ng ganito
Sana nama'y magkatotoo

Iisa lang ang tinitibok ng puso
Iisa lang ang tanging mamahalin
Kung may dal'wang mahalagang tao dito sa mundo
Wala ng iba kundi ikaw at ako

Giliw sana'y pakinggan mo
Ang tunay kong nadarama
Totoong pagsinta at wala ng iba pang
Mamahalin at sasambahin

"""When You Believe""",Lani Misalucha,No Album,"

Many nights we prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hope for a song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain
A small, but still, resilient voice
Says hope is very near

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

"""You Don't Have To Say You Love Me""",Lani Misalucha,No Album,"

When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you
And now you've gone away
Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you
And beg you to come home?

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
I can't help but love you
But believe me
I'll never tie you down

Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand

Believe me, believe me, believe me

"""Happiness""",Lea Salonga,"""Small Voice""","

[Lea:]
You know some kids ask us what happiness really is.
Well, to me happiness is a hamburger, going to the movies, new clothes.
Well, what's your happiness, gerard? 

[Gerard:]
My happiness is a hotdog sandwich, new rubber shoes, new t-shirts,
New jeans and also my favorite part of happiness is love.

[Lea:]
Happiness is two kinds of ice cream
Finding your skate key, telling the time
Happiness is learning to whistle
Tying your shoe for the very first time
Happiness is playing the drum in your own school band
And happiness is walking hand in hand

[Gerard:]
Happiness is five different crayons
Knowing a secret, climbing a tree
Happiness is finding a nickel
Catching a firefly, setting him free
Happiness is being alone every now and then
And happiness is coming home again

[Lea:]
Happiness is morning and evening

[Gerard:]
Daytime and nighttime, too

[Both:]
For happiness is anyone and anything at all
That's loved by you

[Gerard:]
Happiness is having a sister

[Lea:]
Sharing a sandwich

[Both:]
Getting along
Happiness is singing together when day is through
And happiness is those who sing with you

Happiness is morning and evening
Daytime and nighttime, too
For happiness is anyone and anything at all
That's loved by you

Songs about rainbows?

And only illusions
Rainbows have nothing to hide

Who says that ev'ry wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on a morning star
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it

There are nights
When I can't help but cry
And I wonder why
You had to leave me

Why did it have to end so soon
When you said that you would never leave me

Tell me
Where did I go wrong
What did I do to make you change
Your mind completely

When I thought
This love would never end
But if this love's not ours to have
I'll let it go with your goodbye

Time moves the summer wind,
I can see your face again
Was it such a tragedy,
being you, being me?

Smoke clears, the picture fades
While I stood back in yesterday
All the strangers come and go,
All of them will never know..

Nobody's touch, feels like your touch
Nobody gets to me that much
Nobody's kiss, moves me inside
And I have no place left to hide
Tell me what can I do,
I have a vision of you..
Tell me what can I do,
with this vision of you..

Did I walk, did you run?
What's the way to love someone?
Oh my darling, did we know
what it meant, when we let go?

Nobody's touch, feels like your touch
Nobody gets to me that much
Nobody's kiss, moves me inside
And I have no place left to hide
Tell me what can I do,
I have a vision of you..
Tell me what can I do,
with this vision of you,
with this vision of you..

How can a candle ever burn so bright?
Casting a shadow on my life
I am blinded by your light
Even without you...

Nobody's touch, feels like your touch
Nobody gets to me that much
Nobody's kiss, moves me inside
And I have no place left to hide
Tell me what can I do,

Tell me what can I do,

The limits of our yesterdays

It wouldn't be the first time 
Over and over, we put our hearts on the line

Everytime we fall 
We get a little stronger, baby 
Everytime we walk away 
It hurts a little more 
Someday we may find 
We can make it last this time 
Until then, we give it all
Everytime we fall (ohh)

When you're gone 
Still burning me 
And I'm jealous of the sun that warms you 
And still I know 
I'm walkin' in your dreams 
And I ain't seen the last of you

Coz there's a part of you 
That never really leaves 
Over and over 
You keep coming back to me

There's always another one to try 
So we're goin' through these changes

That never really leaves 
Over and over 
You keep coming back to me

Everytime we fall, ohhh

Stronger, baby. Stronger, baby

The sweetest songs, fade to echoes in the wind
The best of times must end, so a new day can begin
And the dreams we dream that seem so real at night
Must meet the morning light, and vanish from our sight

It's just goodbye
Remember, time was never our friend
We walked the road together, we came to the end
It's just goodbye
Now I won't tell you not to cry
But I swear that what we had won't die
Cause it isn't over, it's just goodbye

I close my eyes, and I still can see your face
I know the truth of us, can't be bound by time or space
And the joy we shared, the magic that we've known
Is something that we own, though we may be alone

It's just goodbye
Remember, time was never our friend
We walked the road together, we came to the end
It's just goodbye
Now I won't tell you not to cry
But I swear that what we had won't die
Cause it isn't over, it's just goodbye

It's just goodbye
It doesn't really matter why
I know what we had, can never die
Cause I'll always love you
Yes I'll always love you, so it's just goodbye

An old familiar strain from way back then
Every note and every line
It's always been a favorite song of mine

It used to haunt me so some years ago
Reminds of a boy I used to know
And although the melody lives on
The memories and the boy are all but gone

(And/So) while the song still brings that certain glow
And the words still sing of love I know
It isn't quite the way it was before

As if we knew our love would never end
But seasons change
And time erases the tears
As quickly as the river disappers

Afraid for love to fade before it can come true

Like a child again 
I'm at a loss for words
How does one define a crush combined with longing
Longing to possess you oh so dearly
I'm obsessed by you completely
I'll go mad if I can't have you

[CHORUS:]
I can't let you pass me by
I just can't let you go
But I know that I am much too shy to let you know
Afraid that I might say the wrong words and displease you
Afraid for love to fade before it can come true

I can't let you pass me by
I just can't let you go
Let me say the things and say the words to let you know
I would rather say the awkward words than lose you
Or for love to fade before it can come true
Afraid for love to fade before it can come true

My head's in a jam
Can't take you off my mind...

"""Say That You Love Me""",Lea Salonga,"""By Heart""","

My morning starts to shine with teardrops in my eyes
And here I am alone starting to realize
That my days would be brighter
If I could learn to hide
The feelings that I have for you
Keep hurting me inside

Then my day begins with simple thoughts of you
Hoping that tomorrow will be me and you
Sharing dreams with each other
And making them come true
Holding one another
Saying ""All I need is you""

But will you say that you love me
And show me that you care
Say when I need you
You will always be there
But if you go and leave me
This I swear is true
My love will always be with you

Now my nights would end with just one wish, that's you
To hold me in the dark and help me make it through
'Cause the pain that's inside me
Would simply melt away
If I had you here with me
And promise me you'd stay

But will you say that you love me
And show me that you care
Say when I need you
You will always be there
But if you go and leave me
This I swear is true
My love will always be with you

But will you say that you love me
And show me that you care
Say when I need you
You will always be there
But if you go and leave me
This I swear is true
My love will always
My love will always be with you

We used to be one
I can remember when our hearts were very young
You said our love would be forever
But that was such a long, long time ago
A long, long time ago

Time and again
I still remember day after day
When you'd hold me close to you
But they are just a part of yesterday
Such a long, long time ago

Why did it ever have to be this way?
You promised me the moon, the sun, the stars above
How come you suddenly ceased to look my way?
Tell me the truth that you are certain of

Look at me now
The girl you once loved
Look at me now
Grown up but still in love with you
Although it's such a long, long time ago
Such a long, long time ago

The truth just scared me

In his red suit he sled past.

She maybe straightenin' his tie
Maybe in a house or hidden by a hill

Bet they're collecting like ashtrays and art

Their one mistake was givin' up me

So maybe now it's time

And maybe when I'm wake
They'll be there calling me baby, maybe

"""I Enjoy Being A Girl""",Lea Salonga,"""The Broadway Concert""","

I'm a girl, and by me that's only great!
I am proud that my silhouette is curvy,
That I walk with a sweet and girlish gait
With my hips kind of swivelly and swervy.

I adore being dressed in something frilly
When my date comes to get me at my place.
Out I go with my Joe or John or Billy,
Like a filly who is ready for the race!

When I have a brand new hairdo
With my eyelashes all in curl,
I float as the clouds on air do,
I enjoy being a girl!

When men say I'm cute and funny
And my teeth aren't teeth, but pearl,
I just lap it up like honey
I enjoy being a girl!

I flip when a fellow sends me flowers,
I drool over dresses made of lace,
I talk on the telephone for hours
With a pound and a half of cream upon my face!

I'm strictly a female female
And my future I hope will be
In the home of a brave and free male
Who'll enjoy being a guy having a girl... like... me.

When men say I'm sweet as candy
As around in a dance we whirl,
It goes to my head like brandy,
I enjoy being a girl!

When someone with eyes that smoulder
Says he loves ev'ry silken curl
That falls on my iv'ry shoulder,
I enjoy being a girl!

When I hear the compliment'ry whistle
That greets my bikini by the sea,
I turn and I glower and I bristle,
But I happy to know the whistle's meant for me!

I'm strictly a female female
And my future I hope will be
In the home of a brave and free male
Who'll enjoy being a guy having a girl... like... me.

"""Love Look Away""",Lea Salonga,"""The Broadway Concert""","

I have wished before,
I will wish no more.

Love, look away!
Love, look away from me.
Fly, when you pass my door,
Fly and get lost at sea.

Call it a day.
Love, let us say we're through.
No good are you for me,
No good am I for you.

Wanting you so,
I try too much.
After you go,
I cry too much.

Love, look away.
Lonely though I may be,
Leave me and set me free,
Look away, look away, look away... from... me.

"""Someone Else's Story""",Lea Salonga,"""The Broadway Concert""","

Long ago
In someone else's lifetime
Someone with my name
Who looked a lot like me
Came to know
A man and made a promise
He only had to say
And that's where she would be
Lately
Although the feelings run just as deep
The promise she made has grown impossible to keep
And yet I wish it wasn't so
Will he miss me if I go?

In a way
It's someone else's story
I don't see myself
As taking part at all
Yesterday
A girl that I was fond of
Finally could see
The writing on the wall
Sadly
She realized she'd left him behind
And sadder than that she knew he wouldn't even mind

And though there's nothing left to say
Would he listen if I stay?

It's all very well to say you fool it's now or never
I could be choosing
No choices whatsoever.

I could be
In someone else's story
In someone else's life
And he could be in mine
I don't see
A reason to be lonely
I could take my chances
Further down the line
And if
That girl I knew should ask my advice
Oh I wouldn't hesitate she needn't ask me twice
Go now!
I'd tell her that for free
Trouble is, the girl is me
The story is, the girl is me.

"""Too Much For One Heart""",Lea Salonga,"""The Broadway Concert""","

Outside there is a war,
In here the night is still.
The jasmine buds have bloomed,
The way the jasmine will.

And i have given birth to a speckle of dust,
To a sparkle of light
To a small hint of life.

Frail as a flower in the morning
Is this tiny work of art
When i see his face before me
This is too much for one heart

Here like a seedling in the garden
Is a world about to start
How i need you here to share it
This is too much for one heart

Yours, half of all of this is yours
And i swear it on the moon

Soon you will see, the best of you and me
In the smile that is shining
On the face of your son
All alone in my arms I hold such beauty

I want time to stop right here
Make perfection last forever
In which i could disappear, disappear.

Yours, half of all of this is yours
And now i feel you coming near
Here, you will see the best of you and me
For life stories combining
In this life we've begun

I have been living with such wonder
That my soul could burst apart,
Knowing soon well be together
And its too much for one heart.

There's a saying old
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
Seek and we shall find
So I'm gonna seek a certain girl I have in mind
Looking everywhere,haven't found her yet
She's the big affair, I cannot forget
Only girl I ever think of with regret...
I would like to add my initials to her monogram
Oh.. tell me where is the shepperd
For this lost lamb
There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who watch over me
Well, I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who 'li watch over me
Although I may not be the man
Some girls think of as handsome
To her heart I'll carry the key
Oh.. won't you tell her, please,
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need...
Someone to watch over me...

dream of tomorrow and wonder why
the past is holding me, keeping life at bay
I wandered lost in yesterday
wanting to fly, but scared to try

found someone like me
then suddenly nothing would ever be the same
my heart would take reign, and I feel so alive
if someone like you found me.

so many secrets I've longed to share
all I have needed is someone there
to help me see a world I never see before

Facing you who brings me new tomorrows,

How they led me to this place...

Now be treasuring everywhere.
And if life should come to just one question,
Do I hold this moment true?
No trace of sadness,
Always with gladness...
'I DO...'

Beckons me to someone new,
Unexpected, unexplored, unseen,
Filled with promise coming through.

Not above them, but part of them

And out there, living in the sun
Give me one day out there
All I ask is one to hold forever
Out there, where they all live unaware
What I'd give, what I'd dare
Just to live one day out there

Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives
Through the roofs and gables I can see them
Every day they shout and scold and go about their lives
Heedless of the gift it is to be them
If I were in their skin, I'd treasure every instant

Taste a morning out there, like ordinary men

Staring straight back at me
Why is my reflection someone I don't know
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am, though I've tried
When will my reflection show, who I am, inside

How I pray, that a time will come
I can free myself and meet their expectations
On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself
And to make my family proud

They want a docile lamb
No-one knows who I am
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time
When will my reflection show, who I am inside
When will my reflection show, who I am inside

The courage of a dreamer
The innocence of youth
The failures and the foolishness
That lead us to the truth

The hopes that make us happy
The hopes that don't come true
And all the love there ever was
I see this all in you

You are part
Part of the human heart
Part of the human heart
You are part

Of all who took the journey
And managed to endure
The ones who knew such tenderness
The ones who felt so sure

The ones who came before you
The others yet to come
And those who you will teach it to
And those you learned it from

You are part
Part of the human heart
You are part

This is the gift I give
Through your love, you'll live forever

(You are part) forever
(Part of the human heart) forever
You are part (you are part)
Tonight, tonight

Part of the human heart

Be the girl that he's imagined me to be?

If he doesn't, will he know enough to know
That there's more to me than I may always show?

Will he know that there's a world of love
Waiting to warm him?
How I'm hoping that his eyes and ears
Won't misinform him

How I wish that we could meet another day
It's absurd for me to carry on this way
I'll try not to
Will he like me?
He's just got to

When I am in my room alone and I write
Thoughts come easily, words come fluently then
That's how it is when I'm alone, but tonight
There's no hiding behind my paper and pen

Will he know that there's a world of love
Waiting to warm him?
How I'm hoping that his eyes and ears
Won't misinform him

All I know is that I'm tempted not to go
It's insanity for me to worry so

Ice cream
He brought me ice cream!
Vanilla ice cream
Imagine that
Ice cream
And for the first time
We were together
And that was that
Friendly
I got so friendly
That isn't like me
And I was stunned

Will wonders never cease?
Will wonders never cease?
It's been a most fantastic day
And strange as it may seem
My life is like a dream
Because he offered me
Vanilla ice cream

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

And there was music
And there were wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

somewhere down this road
I know someone's waiting
years of dreams just can't be wrong
arms will open wide
I'll be safe and wanted
finally home where I belong
well, starting now, i'm learning fast

home, love, family
there was once a time I must have had them too
home, love, family
I will never be complete until I find you

one step at a time
one hope then another
who knows where this road may go?
back to who I was
on to find my future
things my heart still needs to know

yes, let this be a sign
let this road be mine
let it lead me to my past
to bring me home at last

Why does Saigon never sleep at night?
Why does this girl smell of orange trees?

Why is she cool when there is no breeze?
Vietnam, you don't give answers, do you friend?
Just questions that don't ever end

Why, God, why today?
I'm all through here, on my way
There's nothing left here that I'll miss
Why send me now, a night like this?

Who is the girl in this rusty bed?
Why am I back in a filthy room?
Why is her voice ringing in my head?
Why am I high on her cheap perfume?
Vietnam, hey look, I mean you no offense
But why does nothing here make sense?

Why, God? show your hand
Why can't one guy understand
I've been with girls who knew much more
I never felt confused before

Why me, what's your plan?
I can't help her, no one can
I liked my memories as they were
But now I'll leave remembering her

When I went home before
No one talked of the war
What they knew from TV
Didn't have a thing to do with me
I went back and re-upped
Sure Saigon is corrupt
It felt better to be here
Driving for the embassy

'Cause here if you can pull a string
A guy like me lives like a king

Why such beauty in this place?

"""Meadowlark""",Lea Salonga,"""Live In Concert With The Sydney Symphony Orchestra""","

When I was a girl, I had a favorite story
Of a meadowlark who lived where the rivers wind
Her voice could match the angels in its glory
But she was blind, the lark was blind

An old king came and took her to his palace
Where the walls were burnished bronze and golden braid
And he fed her fruit and nuts from an ivory chalice
And he prayed:

Sing for me, my meadowlark
Sing for me of the silver morning
Set me free, my meadowlark
And I'll buy you a previous jewel
And cloth of brocade and cruel
And I'll love you for life
If you will sing for me

Then one day as the lark sang by the water
The god of the sun heard her in his flight
And her singing moved him so, he came and brought her
The gift of sight, he gave her sight

And she opened her eyes to the shimmer and the splendor
Of this beautiful young god, so proud and strong
And he called to the lark in a voice both rough and tender:
Come along

Fly with me, my meadowlark
Fly with me on the silver morning
Past the sea where the dolphins bark
We will dance on the coral beaches
Make a feast of the plums and peaches
Just as far as your vision reaches
Fly with me

But the meadowlark said no
For the old king loved her so
She couldn't bear to wound his pride
So the sun god flew away
And when the king came down that day
He found his meadowlark had died
Every time I heard that part I cried

And now I stand here, starry-eyed and stormy
Oh, just when I thought my heart was finally numb
A beautiful young man appears before me
Singing, ""Come, oh won't you come?""

And what can I do if finally for the first time
The one I'm burning for returns the glow
If love has come at last it's picked the worst time
Still I know I've got to go

Fly away, meadowlark
Fly away in the silver morning
If I stay, I'll grow to curse the dark
So it's off where the days won't bind me
I know, I leave wounds behind me
But I won't let tomorrow find me
Back this way

Before my past once again
Can blind me, fly away
And we won't wait to say goodbye
My beautiful young man and I

When you know that it might not be true, what do you do?

Careful the things you say
Children will listen

Children will see and learn
Children may not obey
But, children will listen
Children will look to you
For which way to turn
To learn what to be
Careful before you say
""Listen to me""
Children will listen

Careful the wish you make
Wishes are children
Careful the path they take
Wishes come true, not free
Careful the spell you cast
Not just on children
Sometimes the spell may last
Past what you can see
And turn against you
Careful the tale you tell
That is the spell
Children will listen

How can you say to a child who's in flight
""Don't slip away and I won't hold so tight""?
What can you say that no matter how slight
Won't be misunderstood?
What do you leave to your child when you're dead?
Only whatever you put in it's head
Things which your mother and father which were left to them too

Careful what you say

With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June

Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were
Looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow
Now that she's back in the atmosphere

Plain old Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
Tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were
Looking for yourself out there?

Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?

And did you miss me while you were
Looking for yourself?

Nowhere to turn, no one to go to.

When everybody else is sleeping

With the company I'm keeping
The city goes to bed
And I can live inside my head

On my own
Pretending he's beside me
All alone
I walk with him 'til morning
Without him, I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way, I close my eyes and he has found me

In the rain
The pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me forever and forever

And I know it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself and not to him
And although I know that he is blind
Still I say there's a way for us

I love him
But when the night is over
He is gone
The river's just a river
Without him, the world around me changes
The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers

I love him
But every day I'm learning
All my life I've only been pretending
Without me, his world will go on turning
A world that's full of happiness that I have never known

I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you're broken and fed up
I hope we can patch it up together

But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you

"""Dream Again""",Lea Salonga,No Album,"

I'm going up and down each day
My thoughts just keep on spinning
Like an endless ferris-wheel

When will the chaos fade away
Feeling all alone together
Searching for a way to heal

I picture you out outside my door
Can't wait to throw it open wide
Bring you back inside

When can I sing for you once more
I miss the music and the crowd
I wanna live out loud
Again

My heart's been holding out so long
That we will be together once again
Let's fill the silence with a song
Our melody will live to softened
My friend
It's time to dream again

When you have wings you need to fly
But I've been grounded by this winter
Growing restless day by day

The sun will rise and so will I
From way up here
The things I fear will slowly melts away

I hear the songbird so much more
The day is breaking clear now
You are near now

Maybe we're stronger than before
Your light has been a gift to me
It's lifted me again

My heart's been holding out so long
That we will be together once again
Let's fill the silence with a song
Our melody will live to softened
My friend
It's time to dream again

"""He's Got To Be Someone""",Lea Salonga,No Album,"

You don't know him
Like I know him
He must be allowed to stand proud
If you shame this man and make him crawl
He'd be no man at all, no man at all

He's got to be someone
Who wakes every morning
And takes on the world for a limb
Who touches your hand and makes you fall for only him

And he's got to be someone
Who's strong as a lion yet sweet as a meadowlark's song
Who makes any dream seem like you'd love to go along

Oh, everything about him is a contradiction
Built a boundless empire with the heart of a child
I'd trade it all if I could just recall
The last time the Emperor smiled

And he's got to be someone
Who burns with a passion that never ever sets him free
Oh, please say tonight might relieve him of his misery
And bring back the someone I knew to me...

And furnish it with love

And keep it company

I'd like to see the world for once
All standing hand in hand
And hear them echo through the hills
For peace throughout the land

Let the world sing today
A song of peace that it goes on
And never goes away

Show me what loves all about

Let's forget the past
I swear we'll make this last
Cos' I remember the taste of your skin tonight
And the way that you looked you had those eyes
I remember the way I felt inside
And the name of the songs that made you cry
You would scream, we would fight, you would call me crazy
And I would laugh, you were mad but you'd always kiss me
In the shirt that I had that you always borrowed
When I woke, it was gone
There was no tomorrow

I want you to want me to stay
And I need you to need me to stay
If you say that you don't feel a thing
If you don't know, let me go,
Let me go, let me go, let me go

Never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I lived as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself

And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees
And the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me

There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through
I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be
Just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

[repeat chorus x2]

"""Umbrella Song""",Lea Salonga,No Album,"

On the poor side of town, lives a girl no one knows
With her worn out shoes and her ragged clothes
Her mother tries to provide since her father has died
But no one even cares if she's alive

And when the rain comes down
She's never getting wet
And though the skies are gray
She'll still be smiling yet

Cause in her eyes there's no teardrops
In her heart there's no pain
She's got her love as an umbrella from the rain
Oh, what love is an umbrella from the rain

On the rich side of town, lives a boy no one knows
With his shiny shoes and his fancy clothes
He's got everything he needs if he wants to succeed
But no one even cares if he's alive

And when the rain comes down
He's never getting wet
And though the skies are gray
He'll still be smiling yet

Cause in his eyes there's no teardrops

In his heart there's no pain
He's got his love as an umbrella from the rain
Oh, his love is an umbrella from the rain

Isn't life feeling strange and money can't buy
All you need to get by
All around the world, there are folks no one knows
If they're worn out shoes, their fancy clothes
Will they find more there to give for and open the door
To know that someone cares if they're alive

And when the rain comes down
We're never getting wet
And though the skies are gray
We'll still be smiling yet

Cause in our eyes there's no teardrops
In our hearts there's no pain
We've got a love as an umbrella from the rain
Oh, our love is an umbrella from the rain

And when the rain comes down
We're never getting wet
And though the skies are gray
We'll still be smiling yet

"""We Win As One""",Lea Salonga,No Album,"

We stand today opponents
We strive to bring home pride
And yet our power when combined
Is a force to change the world

Our nations share a common dream
Our roots are old and new
Our stories joyful echoing aparts
Forged to strong and true

Together we're a universe
We are a future world
Yes we compete but the greatest fear is
When we win as one

We win as one unconquered
We win as one
Unbowed we share a single promised
We win as one
Yes we compete but the greatest fear is
When we win
We win
We win as one

Together we're a universe
We are a future world
Yes we compete but the greatest fear is
When we win as one

We win as one unconquered
We win as one
Unbowed we share a single promised
We win as one
Yes we compete but the greatest fear is
When we win
Yes when we win
Yes when we win
We win
We win as one

"""Where Is Love""",Lea Salonga,No Album,"

Where is love? 
Does it fall from skies above? 
Is it underneath the willow tree
That I've been dreaming of? 

Where is she? 
Who I close my eyes to see? 
Will I ever know the sweet hello
That's meant for only me? 

Who can say where she may hide
Must I travel far and wide
'til I am beside
That someone who
I can mean something to? 
Where... where... is love? 

Will I ever know the sweet hello
That's meant for only me
"
"""You""",Lea Salonga,No Album,"

You are the one who makes me happy
When everything else turns to gray
Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings 
And sense me out into the day

You are the crowd that sits quiet
Listening to me
And all the mad sense I make
You are one of the few things worth remembering
And sense it's all true
How could anyone be more to me than you

Sorry if sometimes I look past you
There's no one beyond your eyes
Inside my head wheels are turning 
Hey sometimes I'm not so wise

You are my heart and my soul, my inspiration
Just like the old love song goes
You are one of the few things worth remembering
And sense it's all true 
How could anyone be more to me than you
