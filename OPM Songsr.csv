"""Say Forever""",Rico Blanco,"""Your Universe""","

I'm at the central station
Without a destination, baby it's true, it's true
A million miles from nowhere
Tryin' to get to somewhere, baby with you, with you

Let's go outside stand by my side, say forever
You'll always be the one for me, say forever
I'm always there the one who cares, say forever

Let's go outside stand by my side, say forever
You'll always be the one for me, say forever
I'm always there the one who cares, say forever

Doin' a hundred ninety
The autobahn she loves me more than you do, if you do
Big city life conundrum
Trying to keep myself from fallin' for you, for you

Let's go outside stand by my side, say forever
You'll always be the one for me, say forever
I'm always there the one who cares, say forever

Let's go outside stand by my side, say forever
You'll always be the one for me, say forever
I'm always there the one who cares, say forever

I'm in my final verse and
The situations worse I dunno what to do, do you?
From Marrakesh to Hong Kong
The one thing I want from this world is you, it's true

Let's go outside stand by my side, say forever
You'll always be the one for me, say forever
I'm always there the one who cares, say forever

Let's go outside stand by my side, say forever
You'll always be the one for me, say forever
I'm always there the one who cares, say forever

I'm always there the one who cares, say forever...

Tell me something
When the rain falls on my face
How do you quickly replace it with
A golden summer smile?

Tell me something
When I'm feelin' tired and afraid
How do you know just what to say to make
Everything alright?

I don't think that you even realize
The joy you make me feel when I'm inside
Your universe
You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
I hate to break it to you but its just
The other way around
You can thank your stars all you want but
I'll always be the lucky one

Tell me something
When I'm 'bout to lose control
How do you patiently hold my hand
And gently calm me down?

Tell me something
When you sing and when you laugh
Why do I always photograph my heart
Flyin' way above the clouds?

I don't think that you even realize
The joy you make me feel when I'm inside
Your universe
You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
I hate to break it to you but its just
The other way around
You can thank your stars all you want but
I'll always be the lucky one

Sa gitna ng kagubatan may ahas na hahalik
Tatawagin kang kaibigan na pinaka matalik
Pupulupot sa leeg mo't sisipsip ng iyong dugo
Ipapako ka sa krus kapag ikaw ay natuyo

Sa gitna ng kaguluhan may kumukulong bulkan
Di ma pigil ang yabang at sakdal na kasakiman
Susubukang angkinin ang lahat ng hindi kanya
Kung kaya kang paikutin tiyak paiikutin ka

Ngunit hindi nila kayang baliin ang iyong loob
Ang pag-ibig na hawak mo'y hindi malulubog

Lumiyab ka! Lumiyab

Sa gitna ng kadiliman may buwitreng nagmamasid
May magbabato ng putik ngunit walang mayayanig
Iiyak ang mga batang nahulugan ng candy
Lahat ng mga problema sa iba'y sinisisi

Sa gitna ng kagubatan may ahas na hahalik
Itinuring mong kaibigan na pinaka matalik
Leeg mo'y pupuluputan dugo mo'y sisipsipin
Kapag wala ka nang pakinabang ang ending mo'y sa bangin

Ngunit hindi nila kayang baliin ang iyong loob
Ang pag-ibig na hawak mo'y hindi malulubog

Lumiyab ka!
Lumiyab
Lumiyab

Tuwing hating gabi maririnig mo ang huni
Ng mga kaluluwang naliligaw
Lahat ng pera sa mundo hindi kayang gawing ginto
Ang huwad na tao...

Ang mga tinig palakas ng palakas
Hanggang gumuho ang mga hadlang
Ang mga tinig palakas ng palakas
Hanggang gumuho ang mga hadlang

Saksi ang langit sa lahat ng naganap
Saksi ang langit sa ikalawang yugto

Lumiyab ka!

Lumiyab ka!
(Sa ngalan ng katotohanan)
Lumiyab ka!
(Sa ngalan ng iyong dangal)
Lumiyab
(Ang puso mo'y iyong isipin)
Lumiyab
(Ialay mo sa may kapal)

"""Helpless""",Rico Blanco,"""Your Universe""","

The morning wakes
I find myself entangled
Envisions of your warm embrace
I pour some coffee
And slowly swirl in memories
Of the night we watched the stars fade into space

I'm addicted to your
Tender kisses and it's keeping me up all night
I didn't expect that I'd be
So affected every time you look me in the eyes
I become so helpless, helpless

Day moves along
The symptoms only aggravate like
Wishing for a passerby
To stop a while
And listen to my story of
How much brighter you've made my life

I'm addicted to your
Tender kisses and it's keeping me up all night
I didn't expect that I'd be
So affected every time you look me in the eyes
I become so helpless, helpless

"""Start Again""",Rico Blanco,"""Your Universe""","

Is it too late to stop
This pain that I created
From eclipsing the million
Precious things we shared
Is it too late I realized
I've been such a fool
Is it too late I just want

One more chance to hold your hand again
Once more chance to be the one your heart beats for again

If it's okay I'd like
A minute to speak with you
I'm sure that he will understand
Just want to say that you're
The best to ever happen to me
If it's okay I just want

One more chance to be your guiding light
One more chance to be the one who makes things right again

One more chance to paint your brighter days
One more chance to be the reason you're okay

One more chance to kiss you in the dark
One more chance to never-ever be apart
I promise I won't break your heart
Baby please, can we just start again?

"""When The Wheels Turn""",Rico Blanco,"""Galactik Fiestamatik""","

I'm waiting in the corner of the sun
Collapsin' in the weight of what we've done
Outside I see the silence of your dreams
Inside a little shadow of what seems to have been

And there's no way of knowing
When all these heartlights will return
And there's no way were fallin'
When the wheels turn

You take a sip from their cup of advice
Your enervated heart scattered the dice
Now all we built just feels like a mistake
The love we had before has turned to hate, to hate

And there's no way of knowing
When all these heartlights will return
And there's no way were fallin'
When the wheels turn

And in the distant silence
No pain, no sorrow will forgive
And I am left to wonder, ""have I wronged you?""
Until the summer wakes up
I will be laughing through my pain
There'll be no words of wisdom
When the wheels turn
When the wheels turn
When the wheels turn

Losing touch of my heart
I'm compromising when the hell did this start

Feels way too fast
We know these things don't last
But we pretend like we've got all the time in our hands

Why does it feel so right
To walk away from you
Why doesn't it feel wrong
To get over the things we used to do

Not any other, not a crush
Never together, kinda rushed
I'd rather not say so things are kept this way

The chasing had to end the inevitable now said
You are the simplest and the hardest to understand

Why does it feels so right
To walk away from you
Why doesn't it feel wrong
To get over the things we used to do

At the end of the day, oh
What I wish I could say
Is I tried to love you
All the way, all the way

Why does it feel so right
To walk away from you
Why doesn't it feel wrong
To get over the things we used to

Feel so right to walk away from you
Why doesn't it feel wrong
To get over the things we used to do
To get over the things we used to do
To get over the things we used to do

"""Baka Sakali""",Rico Blanco,No Album,"

Takot na 'kong sumubok
Pagod na 'kong lumakad sa bubog
Ang pag-ibig ay para lang
Sa matatapang at tanga

Hinarap ko na ang langit
Isinuko bawat luha at galit
Ngunit ba't kung kailan 'di
Ka na naniniwala biglang ayan

Dito ka lang sa aking tabi
Baka sakali o baka naman
Dito ka lang pumalagi
Baka sakali mapasaakin ka

Hindi na 'ko natuto
Hindi na rin marunong magtago
Sa tuwing ika'y kapiling ko
Ang aking puso buong-buo

Dito ka lang sa aking tabi
Baka sakali o baka naman
Dito ka lang pumalagi
Baka sakali mapasaakin ka

Ano ba ang dapat mong gawin?
Kung ang pangarap ay binigay ng mga bituin

Dito ka lang sa aking tabi
Baka sakali o baka naman
Dito ka lang pumalagi
Baka sakali mapasaakin ka

Dito ka lang sa aking tabi
Baka sakali o baka naman
Dito ka lang pumalagi
Baka sakali mapasaakin ka

Dito ka lang sa aking tabi
Baka sakali o baka naman
Dito ka lang pumalagi
Baka sakali mapasaakin ka

The things you do to me
You got me grooving
With your electricity

Every morning I feel so psyched
To spend the day with you
And at night I sleep with such a vibe
'Cause you give me a

You give me a happy feelin'
I feel it from my fingers to my toes
Everyday the smile in my heart grows
You give me a happy feelin', yeah-yeah

Happy feelin', you give me a
Happy feelin'

No other way to say this
You are my destiny
No matter where we go, it's
Just where I wanna be

Driving up to bluer skies
We're on top of the world
My sweet honey, you are love refined

You give me a happy feelin'
I feel it from my fingers to my toes
Everyday the smile in my heart grows
You give me a happy feelin', let's go

Happy feelin', you give me a

Fighting the invisible
In a war that seems unwinnable

"""You'll Be Safe Here""",Rico Blanco,No Album,"

Nobody knows, just why we're here
Could it be fate or random circumstance
At the right place, at the right time
Two roads intertwine

And if the universe conspired
To meld our lives, to make us, fuel and fire
Then know wherever you will be
So too, shall I'll be

Close your eyes, dry your tears
'Cause when nothing seems clear
You'll be safe here from the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Weary heart, you'll be safe here

Remember how we laughed until we cried
At the most stupid things like we were so high
But love was all that we were on, we belong

And though the world would never understand
This unlikely union and why it still stands
Someday, we will be set free
Pray and believe

When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you
You'll be safe here (Ooh ooh, ahh hah ahh)

Save your eyes from your tears
When everything's unclear
You'll be safe here from the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears wounded heart

When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you you'll be safe here
In my arms through the long cold night
Sleep tight, you'll be safe here
When no one understands
I'll believe, you'll be safe
You'll be safe, you'll be safe here, ooh ooh

Put your heart in my hands
You'll be safe here

Fly high & proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost had it all

Baby saw that when they pulled that big top down
They left behind her dreams among the litter
And a different kind of love she thought she found
There was nothing left but saw dust and some glitter
But baby, can't be broken, cause you see
She had the finest teacher that was me

Kung alam mo lang
Matagal na kitang minamahal
Simula't sapul palang
Ikaw nag tibok ng puso ko
Ngunit di mo pansin aking mga tingin
Sayang na sayang lang sinta
Mahal panaman kita
ba ako sakaling malaman mo
Baka iwasan mo mga tingin ko sayo
Sana'y maunawaan mo damdaming kong ito
Kahit mayroon ka nang ibang minamahal sa buhay mo
Kung alam mo lang kung gano kita kamahal
Nagtitiis, nagdurusa sa twing kapiling mo sya
Kung alam mo lang na mahal na mahal kita
Ngunit ako'y lalayo nang di na muling masaktan
Paalam na sinta at di ko na ito kaya
Pangarap ko nalang makakasama ko ikaw
Baka sakaling doon lang ako'y iyong pakinggan
Dinggin mo pagsamo ko
At malaman mong mahal kita

There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love, thru his indifference
A heart that cared that went unshared
Until it died within his silence

And solitaire is the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again
And keeping to himself, he plays the game
Without the love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
There was a man, a lonely man
Who would command the hand he's playing

And solitaire is the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again
And keeping to himself, he plays the game
Without a love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

You and me, we wanted it all...we wanted it all...
Passion without pain
Sunshine without rainy days
We wanted it all always...

You and me we reached for the skies
Even if it falls high
Never giving in, certain we were in the pride
I should have seen it in your eyes

Look how all the dreams came true
You see how I'm complete
You see how you got you

And after all just one thing died
A little thing called love
We used to feel inside

You and me (you and me)
We're not like the rest (we're not like the rest)
We once were the best
Back when we were young
How did we become so smart
And learn to break each other's hearts

Nothing we were taught
How did we become so smart

Isn't it a crying shame

"""Through The Rain""",Rachelle Ann Go,"""Rachelle Ann Go""","

When you get caught in the rain with no where to run 
When you're distraught and in pain without anyone 
When you keep crying out to be saved 
But nobody comes and you feel so far away 
That you just can't find your way home 
You can get there alone 
It's okay, what you say is 

I can make it through the rain 
I can stand up once again on my own 
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend 
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith 
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain 

And if you keep falling down don't you dare give in 
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly 
And you'll find what you need to prevail 
What you say 

I can make it through the rain 
I can stand up once again on my own 
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend 
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith 
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain 

And when the wind blows, as shadows grow close don't be afraid 
There's nothing you can't face 
And sure they tell you you'll never pull through 
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say-ay-yeah-yeah-hey-ey-yeah 

I can make it through the rain 
I can stand up once again on my own 
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend 
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith 
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain 

I can make it through the rain 
And stand up once again 
And I live one more day and night 
And I can make it through the rain

You're gonna make it through the rain...

In the world of harmony
Every people can be free
To achieve the dreams
And live the life so gladly
Like a pair of symphony
Different dreams and distance pits
But the sounds can make
Fulfill one melody

Someday the sun will come out shining
Shinning or not the light is bringing
Turning the way so clear for every one to see

We are one people
We have the power to change the world
We have and make it
Such a better place to live in
We are on people let's soar up
Together to reach
Just come and go
We are to learn just how to move in unity

Different times have being strive
There's a moment to unite
Cause in every heart
Who find the love inside?
There is room that still divides
Or abilities in mind
All the selfish dreams
Let's put them on the side

Someday the sun will come out shining
Shinning or not the light is bringing
Turning the way so clear for every one to see

Wondering if you're thinking of me too
Though I try to close my eyes I'm filled with thoughts of you
Even in my dreams there's none but you

Let me say it one more time
The words I keep inside
This heart of mine has something to reveal 
That you're always in my prayer
And this time to you I swear
There's nothing I won't do for you

I care

Friends they say that I might fall in love deeply with you
Would you care if what they say is true
Never been like this before and never had a clue
If this is love, I'm sure it's something new

Oh how I wish you feel the same for me
Baby when you look at me
That's how you seem to be

I never gonna let you go

I think of you all the time
Can you be in my fantasy?
We're alone 'cause no ones around
I know that this is it
We got that special bond
I feel the love everywhere

You are my obsession now
Burning in my heart somehow
You are my fire painted with desire
You are my obsession now
Burning in my heart somehow
Everywhere I go, I hold you in my heart
I know my obsession

I wish that you would say
I want you here all the time
But I know that you love me
I feel it in my mind
Look around there's no one else
Than I fancy as much as you
You know that this is it you

except the one I sent up with you
I dont wanna change a thing

when every wish I make is coming true with you

Sometimes I forget to say how much I love you
Purposely I bet cause I'm so busy thinking of you

So in this world of odds and ends

When you loved me back and your heart was beating for me too

You came shining with the glimmer of hope
Flipped a coin into the wishing well
And started the magic spell

When you loved me back and your heart was beating for me too

"""It Wasn't Enough""",Rachelle Ann Go,No Album,"

We've been through a lot you and I
All in the name of love
Instead of finding paradise
It's been a game of push and shove
Sometimes in the morning we seem to get along so well
But by the night,I wonder if you're friend or foe
Coz I can't really tell
And I'm askin' myself what did I forget
Where did I go wrong?
I'm not short on my faith but I' tellin' you
This has gone on for so long

It wasn' t enough to believe in you,with everythin' I had
It wasn't enough,though whether rain or shine
I was here through good and the bad
I can't carry all the load this way
I can't keep us in love alone
There's gotta be more than me I gave it all
It wasn't enough

"""The Search Is Over""",Rachelle Ann Go,No Album,"

How can I convince you
What you see is real
Who am I to blame you
For doubting what you feel

I was always reachin'
You were just a boy
I knew I took for granted
The friend I have in you

I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Can we last forever
We'll we fall apart
At times it's so confusing
The questions of the haert

So if you ever loved me
And patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses
Through some miracle of faith

I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style

Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck
It finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway's leading me back to you

Now at last I hold you
Now all is said and done
The search has come full circle
Our destinies are one

So if you ever loved me
Show me that you gave a damn 
You'll know for certain
The girl I really am

I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
When I touched your hand
I could hear you whisper
The search is over
Love was right before my eyes

Will there really be a morning 
When the night is gone
Will there be a dawn 
To greet me urge me to go on
Is there no home for me
To even love again

Will there really be a morning 
Or is this the end
Will there really be a sunrise when 
The darkness dies
Will the strength to last'll be there
To fight the fears inside
The nights are so endless
Endless as it seems

Will there really be a morning or 
Is this a dream
Days have come and days have passed
I wish the morning stayed 
I pray that they would last
For in those mornings I 
Could see what it meant to be free
Will there really be light again
When this tunnel fades
Will I reach out and touch it
Ir will I be afraid
I just hoped that 
I'll still be there just that
I may see
Will there really be a morning to
Come for me
For in those mornings
I could see what it meant 
To be free

Will there really be a morning to
Come for me

So baby hold me tight and love me

Here we are, two fools in love again
Hoping that this love would never end
Look at out two hearts, not willing to fall apart
Hoping we're still together until the morning comes
[Regine]
Look at us, lying to ourselves
Can't accept this love's for someone else
Let's leave it all behind, make sure that love ain't blind
Leaving room for tomorrow for hearts may meet again

How can we let this love slip away
Can we just save it all for some other day
Only two fools will try to keep this love alive
But without you
Don't know if I'll survive

I made myself a promise sometime ago
Never again to give my heart away
I fell in love with someone who left me in the end
The price of love was just so high to pay
I thought my life has ended but you came along
And showed me how much brighter things could be
Now you see I've turned my back on that promise that I made
Knowing that your love has set me free

'Cause you are reason enough for me to go on living
You are reason enough for me to smile again
In a world where hearts are broken every now and then
One finds reason enough to love
Like I found reason enough in you to love again

There was a time when I lived my life
Thinking only of the things that would bring me down
And all the while what I didn't know
Is that I never learned to take the time to look around
There's a little good in everyone
And sometimes it takes a little work to see the sun
If you try you may find your life has just begun
Don't you run
Don't you run 

If you're feeling lost
If you wanna be free
If you feel like your world is tearing up at the seams
Remember there's light
If you wait till the dawn
You may walk through the clouds
But to carry on
You've got to follow the sun

Break your heart you've got your own self to blame

Why can't I cast away this mask of clay
And live my life
Why can't I fall in love

And, love, I'm falling fast

"""My Sweet Home""",Regine Velasquez,"""My Love Emotion""","

The morning came as memories faded with the night
Another day began without you
Each time I have this feeling
I find myself believing
You will soon come home to my arms
It's not the case I told myself a million times
The sweet embraces that we knew then
Are written in the pages
That first love story gave me
Reason to be strong and carry on
Everything is so different now
Inside the freedom that love allows
I've got on reason to regret anymore
Love is water for hearts to grow
Though it's over for us I know
I'll  always treasure what we learned as one and shared together
It's nice to know I have a place to call my own
Returning to my sweet, sweet home
Sometimes when romance comes it's easy to believe
That perfect love appears to take you, ooh
Till where your dreams had come true
There's just one happened with you
Till we saw the light and let it go
All I need is for you to know
When you loved me you gave me hope
I'll keep those memories inside of my heart
If you see that you need a friend
I will be there until the end
Now I continue on like this until the future brings me
Someone to fill the space I only have for now
It's all I've got my sweet sweet home
Everything is so different now
Inside the freedom that love allows
I've got no reason to regret anymore
Love is water for hearts to grow
Though it's over for us I know
I'll always treasure hat we learned as one and shared together
It's nice to know I have a place to call my own
Returning to my sweet sweet home [x3]
My sweet, my sweet sweet home

Rushing around, laughing out loud

Maybe next year we'll say hello again

A father, a mother, and a child

We're the first gifts of love 
Given to a poor child by kings 
A shepherd and his lambs 
Gathered around to see a miracle 
On a peaceful night angels sung and prayed 

Picture of love on a cold December night 
A father, a mother, and a child

Flowers you left me here
Still wilt on the shelf by the phone
You took a part of me 
All the tears I cry for you

It's day by day for me
The only way I get by
I keep talking in my sleep
As if you were still right by my side, baby

How could you leave
Need you with me
All of the precious memories
Just left me behind
And how my heart cry
Without you I'm so lost baby
I still can't believe
That you could just leave 
Standing alone in misery
Just left me behind
Please come back baby

I pray I call your name
Still wishing that you would come home
Nothing comforts me 
But if you could hold me

My world will start to turn
For a moment that things would be right
Can you hear me
Baby don't you need me too

Are you afraid of me
Please tell me how love passed us by
Right now I would do anything
Just to have you right back in my life, baby

All of the pain and the hurt trapped inside
Keeps pulling me down and God knows how i try
So hard when you love someone
The way that I loved you
Please come back, we can talk it all out
Time and space my love away for you....

Lalalalalalala...

It's day by day for me
The only way I get by
I keep talking in my sleep
As if you were still right by my side, baby

Baby, I'm so lost, I don't know what to do

"""Once In A Lifetime Love""",Regine Velasquez,"""Drawn""","

Everybody needs somebody 
I'm alone and waiting to find
My once in a lifetime love 

(Once in a lifetime boy)
Heaven if you're listenin' to me 
Tell me when I'm going to find
That once in a lifetime love

Someone to hold someone to kiss 
I've seen his face a million times
In my dreams
Passion that's real
Love I can feel
Here in my heart
I can see

All that I need perfect is here 
So sensitive and warm and
Gentle with me
Will this dream be reality 
If so then tell me 
Love this would be
So many nights
Spend all alone
I need a love
That I can call my own
Tell me how long before 
I find my one true love
Is there an answer
From heaven above

(Is the love for me
And it's meant to be
I'm waiting patiently
When will it come to me
Everything I need not just 
A fantasy
Will it come to me...)
My love is waiting for you, baby, please...

Am I gonna find, yeah, yeah...

"""Messin' With My Head""",Regine Velasquez,"""Drawn""","

Waited up for you all night, you didn't call
You left me here waiting, anticipating
So I called you on your phone and
Unexpectedly, I talked to her
She said you don't belong to me
How could you look into my eyes
And straight up lie to me
Your drag ascended so stop pretending
I would rather be alone 'cause I deserve much more
I can't believe my friends could see, they told me so

I know your messin' with my head
I know you're sleepin' in her bed
Last night you was away, you said, you'd be
I'm tired of you playing me
Don't you even care I'm just a number that 'cha share
How could you even dare
So stop your dogging me and playing me

I don't wanna hear I'm sorry
'Cause I'm tired of you sounding like a broken record
If you're pleading at the door, I've heard it all before
I'm not afraid to be alone, I'll find my own
Had all the times that we made love
You have me feeling like
I was your one and only lover
But it's okay 'cause I have something waiting for me
That can give me what you couldn't give and so much more

I know your messin' with my head
I know you're sleepin' in her bed
Last night you was away, you said, you'd be

Don't you even care I'm just a number that 'cha share
How could you even dare
So stop your dogging me and playing me

So now I really don't care
'Cause your game has pushed me over the edge
You put our love to the test
So many other guys would like to come beat time with me
You've lost your chance baby so no, you just got to go

I know your messin' with my head
I know you're sleepin' in her bed
Last night you was away, you said, you'd be
I'm tired of you playing me
Don't you even care I'm just a number that 'cha share
How could you even dare
So stop your dogging me and playing me

I know your messin' with my head
I know you're sleepin' in her bed

Have felt the rain and thunder in my heart 
I feel so all alone 
And baby I 
Could put away the sorrow and the past 
I don't wanna lose my soul 

I've tried so many times 
I've given love a chance 
And everytime I try 
It seems to never last 
I wanna give to you my all 
But my heart won't take a chance 

Show me how to find a way to love again 
It seems impossible 
To find true love again 
Tell me how to find a way to love again 
It seems so hard I try 
To find a love that's mine 

Now give me time 
To understand the heartache and the pain 
I've been here before 
And baby I 
I wanna give my life, my trust to you 
I can't seem to let it go 

'Cause every time I try 
Pain lingers in the past 
It's like no one seems to care 
Life doesn't ever last 
Although my heart still yearns for you 
I'm just afraid to face the truth, woohh 

Show me how to find a way to love again 
It seems impossible 
To find true love again 
Tell me how to find a way to love again 
It seems so hard I try 
To find a love that's mine

With all these tears I cannot hide

Wouldn't have told you

To think you gave me the strength
To hold on to

I put my trust in you
You helped me search to find myself
Life's lessons that you shown me
We laughed, we cried and sing
And nobody else could console me
A special bond but then 
Never have thought I could feel oh
So lonely forever thought I have you
So unexpectedly you left me here
All by myself 
Now I need you here to hold me

Where are you now
Miss you so much 
I can't explain the hurt I feel
Where are you now
You were my breathe of life
The answers to my needs
I don't know why you left
Me in the rain
I prayed every night
Keep calling out your name
Where are you now

That pretty smiling face
Can't escape from my mind
You're my only 
That keeps me on my way
Keeps my heart beating 
Still oh so slowly
I think I'm going crazy
I don't know what to do
The thought of leaving you
Just scares me baby help me

Sharing lovely moments that spell forever 
Day after day our love gets stronger 
Growing every minute that we get closer

If we ever have to say goodbye 
And go our own separate ways 
I wouldn't know how to get by on my own 
After all the love and passion you have shown

I'll never say goodbye 
No matter how they try 
To show we love won't last 
If we're prisoners caught in our past

Don't let your tears run dry 
No need for you to cry 
I promise I will stay 
I'm with you all the way

In time they'll soon forget 
That you and I once met 
As long as deep inside 
I know its love not pride 
Then I will never say ever say good-bye

I'll never say goodbye 
There are no reasons why 
Our souls are so in twined 
There is us not you and I

Our friends will soon regret 
Regretting we once met 
Because we'll show them all 
With love we can't walked tall 
And we will never say ever say good-bye

Flying high upon the wings of love

Sitting just this near to me

One dream of my young life
Now stands holding out his hand to me
Now I can't help but believe
That my whole life will be
Spent in one love

Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, gettin' in the swing
You come in to look for a king

Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...

You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen, feel the beat of the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen

Leave them burnin' and then you're gone

Soft as can be
When you're in love with me

Love to be
Riding the waves of your love
Enchanted with your touch
Seems to me we can sail together
In and out of misery

Oooohh
I wanna be livin' for the love of you
All that I'm givin', givin'
For the love of you
Is for the love of you

Aha
You're my lollipop
You're my lemondrop
You're my sweet pea
You're my queen bee
When i look into your eyes
Like a ray of sunshine
You're the kind of girl
I wanna sport
When I'm on a roller ride
I'ts love I'm livin'
All for you
The first girl in my life
That I'll always be true
Some get jealous
Of what we got
But there's no way to stop
All the feelings we got
Just the little things
That made me gig with you
The way you look in my eyes
The way you find the time
The way you touch my hand
When I'm not in demand
The way you make me feel fine
When I'm cryin' at night
Paradise within my mind
So i huff and I puff
But you know I ain't trippin'
I told you before that I'll only be livin'
For the love of you, my boo

I wanna be livin'
For the love
For the love of you girl
All that I'm givin'
Is for the love of you
That's why everything I do
I do for you

Might as well
Sign my name on a card
That could say it better
Time will tell
Cause it seems that
I've done just about 
All that I can do

I wanna be livin' for the love of you
All that I'm givin' is for the love of you
Is for the love of you
You ... you ... you ...
Givin' ...
Oooh ooh ooh ooh
Driftin' on a mem'ry
I wanna livin for your love

Hey Regine!
What?

What's up?
What's up?

Guess what?
What?

We're livin' for the love of you

So much fear that cannot subside. you see I dided but then I rose
Giving up on my life was close. But now I'm back on my toes

And then I'll know where to start. I'm gonna cruise, I'm gonna flow
Nothing's gonna stop me from my destiny

You made me see the dream. Inside my heart. You are the end and I will start

You are the hope. You are the joy. Through everyone. Through everywhere 
You let me die. You made me rise. giving up on my life was close

Time goes by after sad goodbye-s. 
So many changes meeting new faces
Different places with different cases. 
For other concerns your heart now burns

Can we still be together I ask. 
On my shy face I put on a mask
Am I a block to your destiny. 
Or maybe I should just let you be

Maybe I should learn to call on you. 
Like what you used to do when you're blues

Bring back yesterday I sing. 
When friendship was a spontaneous thing
Am I part of your destiny. 
Or maybe I should just let you be

Time moves in circles. 
Here I hope for miracles. 
Lost in confusion. 
I don't know how to move on

Am I too selfish on my part. 
Thinking you left me. 
Now we're apart. 
But it's unfair of you to leave me here. 
Living your dreams while I weep here in tears

If this love knows no bounds
But when I wake up from this dream

That softly kisses my skin

These are what you are to me

Each morning when I open my eyes
I find myself more in love with you
Each second makes up a minute
That leads to an hour of thinking of us two

Each wish that I make before I sleep
Is for us to be together I pray
Each year I have 365 dreams
About you and me
That our love will always stay

You're a friend to me
You're my family
You're my pillar of strength
Someone I aspire to be

When the stars begin to hide

Been said and done

Flowers for you, on this lovely evening
Though they have no words they share my feelings
As we walk along the avenue
Pardon me, I just can't help staring at you

When I look into those sparkling eyes
I float in the air and wander in paradise
You give my heart a source of inspiration
Your beauty is beyond imagination

[CHORUS:]
You are the one
The only one that I desire
When we touch
When we're one you light the fire
The seasons we share 
Hand in hand, there seems to be no time
Each day with you becomes a Valentine

Time must go on and so must we
Moments slip away but not the memories
One day as we look back with all this treasure
Candlelight that shines beyond forever

You are the one,
The only one that I desire

At times when I'm alone I feel so empty
I've always wish you're here
And now you're gone and all is gone forever
Oh girl it's so unfair

Remember the things I always say
I mean them all so please believe
The things that I've been telling you

Just hang on
Who knows we might get there 
After all the waiting's done
We'll be the ones to find out

You don't have to be beautiful
To turn me on
I just need your body, baby
From dusk till dawn
You don't need experience
To turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
I'll show you what it's all about

You don't have to be rich to be my guy
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your KISS

You got to not talk dirty, baby
If you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty, mama
I know how to undress me
I want to be your fantasy
Maybe, you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me
We could have a real good time

You don't have to be rich to be my guy
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your KISS

I think I'd better dance now.....
Women, not girls, rule my world
I said they rule my world
Act your age woman, not your shoe size
Maybe we could do the twirl?
You don't have to watch Dynasty
To have an attitude
You just leave it all up to me
My love will be your food

You don't have to be rich to be my guy
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign, I'm more compatible with,
I just want your extra time and your KISS

Tell me that you love me,
Tell me that you care
I just want to hear your voice
Come floating through the air
Telephones are lonely
Tell me youâre alright
I just want to feel you near
When I lay down tonight.

Iâd give anything to see your face
Just to share the silence of your eyes
Your love is something no one can replace
While Iâm gone I donât want you to cry
Please donât cry.

Tell me that you love me,

Tell me that you need me
Tell me itâs alright
I just want to hear your voice

Iâd give anything to taste your kiss
Just to feel your body touching mine
It hurts me to be wanting you like this
So tell me that you love me one more time
One more timeâ¦

Tell me that you love me

How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand

And yes I know how lonely/loveless life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get/bring me down
Now that you're around me

And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do

The book of life is brief
And once a page is read
All but love is dead
That is my belief

"""At Seventeen""",Regine Velasquez,"""Low Key""","

I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on those more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say ""Come, dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown-eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said ""Pity please the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve""
The rich relationed hometown queen 
Marries into what she needs
A guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game
And lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payments due
Exceed accounts received
At seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repeating other lives unknown
Who call to say ""Come dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me, at seventeen

"""She's Always A Woman""",Regine Velasquez,"""Low Key""","

And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child
But she's always a woman to me

She can lead you to love
She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But she'll never believe
And she'll take what you've give her, as long as it's free
Yeah, she steals like a thief
But she's always a woman to me

[Chorus:]
Oh, she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind

And she'll promise you more
Than just garden of eden
Then she'll carelessly cut you
And laugh while you're bleeding
But she'll bring out the best
And the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself
Cause she's always a woman to me

[Repeat chorus]

She is frequently kind
And then suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases
She's nobody's fool
And she can't be convicted
She earned her degree
And the most she will do
Is throw shadows at you
But she's always a woman to me...

Hide myself behind my tears
And I'll
Never be the same without your love

The years go by
There's always someone new
To try and help me forget about you
Time and again it does me no good
Love never feels the way that it should

I loved you then I guess I'll love you forever
And even though I know we could never stay together
I think about how it could have been
If we could just start all over again

"""Leader Of The Band""",Regine Velasquez,"""Low Key""","

An only child alone and wild
A cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none 
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know 
I never can repay

A quiet man of music
Denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once
But his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline
A thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls
Took me years to understand.

The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument
And his song is in my soul 
My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man

My brothers' lives were different
For they heard another call
One went to Chicago
And the other to St. Paul
And I'm in Colorado
When I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose
And come to know so well.

I thank you for the music
And your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness
And the times when you got tough
And, papa, I don't think I
Said 'I love you' near enough

Trimming trees and santaâs toys
Itâs mom and dad granâ and grandpa too

A chance for hope and peace on earth
Itâs everything that we hold clear and true
But most of all, Christmas is the love that lives
Inside of me and you

Sleepy eyes are open wide
And tiny hearts beat fast
To celebrate the morning
Just like every Christmas past
We gathered close to family
Embracing all thatâs been
And all thatâs yet to be
Oh itâs good to be reminded

Christmas is the candle light
Jingle bells and silent night
Friends from long ago
And friends and weâve made anew
Christmas is a sacred birth
A chance for hope and peace on earth
Itâs everything that we hold dear and true
But most of all, Christmas is the love that lives
Inside of me and you

From where it all began
One night in Bethlehem
Reaches out to all of us
Reminds us once again

Christmas is for everyone
The greatest gift of all the stuff
The star that shines on all the world
The light that leads us through
Christmas is a sacred birth
A chance for hope and peace on earth
Itâs everything that we hold dear and true
But most of all, Christmas is the love that lives
Inside of me and you.

You're my Bieber fever, you're my Ashton Kutcher
I'm going Lady Gaga (papa paparazzi) over you

Ooh you are my McDreamy, you're my own McSteamy
Brad Pitt and George Clooney don't stand a chance
You're my one and only true romance

I'll be yours forever and a day
Our love is here to stay
You are my one true romance

Loving you is easy
Though it might sound cheesy
I'm a girl just standing in front of a boy
Asking him to love her
(When you say nothing at all)

You're my super hero
Save me from this sorrow
Sweep me off my feet and fly me away
(Fly me away)
You're my one and only true romance

Magkahawak ang ating kamay
At habang ulo ko'y nakahimlay sa'yong dibdib
Dama ko ang iyong kaba
At paulit-ulit mong bulong sa akin
Ako lang sa puso mo ang iyong iibigin

Sadyang kay tamis ng bawat sandali tulad nito
Sadyang kay sarap damhin ng init ng pag-ibig mo
Di mapigil labi ko'y nangingiti
Di na namalayang luha sa pisngi
At bulong ko sa aking sarili
Sana, manatili tayo'y ganito

Ang nais ko ay yakapin ka ngayon
Nais kong ipadama sa'yo
Na mahal na mahal na mahal kita
Sana'y laging ganito

You are my King and I
Your Queen and
Everything you say goes
It's not that I obey everything you say

But I bet you can't come up with one
That'll make me say no...no you can't make me
You are the sun an I your moon
Though we both light the sky up
I love the way you warm up my day
And hope you like the way I cool you down inside

Still you heat up my nights
We're a one two combination
All we need is you and me to complete the equation
One without the other's nothing
Though it might sound weird
Here numbers can't reveal half the answer

[Chorus:]
Aahhaaa Ooohhhooo
I'm wakin' up to a dream, acting a fairy tale
What more can I ask for when you had perfectly
Written our parts out

Recite me a line
From a favorite page of our own storybook
Take me to places
Where my heart has never been
Ahh ahhahh oooh hoo

You hold the only key to my door
And opened up my soul;
You made me a believer when faith was running low
And I didn't know where to go
Then you showed up right on cue

Love you and you love me back
The word ""need"" doesn't say enough
Won't stand up to the emotion
One without the other can't ever be
It's the truth. it's no secret, no mystery

[Chorus:]
Aahhaaa Ooohhhooo
I'm wakin' up to a dream, acting a fairy tale
What more can I ask for
When you have perfectly plotted our destiny?

Recite me a line
From a favorite page of our own storybook
Take me to places
Where my heart has never been

Whisper a phase, Sing me a song
From our own movie soundtrack
Take me to heights as we rehearse and play
Our parts each day
Ahhhhahhh...

You are my King and I
Your Queen and
Everything you say goes

I've been working hard for awhile
Working hard since I was a child
Falling in and out of stories, movies
Where I always got my happy ending
So tell me why does
Love have to be so complicated
Is finding true love so overrated?
I've tried to raid out for Prince Charming
And I found a funny one

Who loves me, I love him
He's my someone, someone
I can depend on

You can agree with my choices
You can frown and be one of the voices
Or you can pray for me
'Cause we all need prayers in this world

You can agree with my choices
You can frown and be one of the voices
Or you can pray for me

I've seen it all before
There's a hard working girl on the dance floor
In the fast face world she just wants to have some fun
Come on and try and understand
I don't know what you're might be thinking
But don't rather judge
'Cause we all need prayers in this world

I wanna show up on my wedding one day
That's today

Comes from the heart of all of you
Who shared your lives, your efforts
Your blessings and your time
To heal us folks born with aberrations
Instead of smiles
Oh how I wish they'd all see
The thousand words you painted on me

So much in life excites me
So many I would love to enumerate
The smile that you see in my face now
Is a miracle of love
From the hands of the artist
Who had to rectify
Connect the dots, put in order
And top it with a smile
Oh how I wish they'd all be
A masterpiece just like me

Ohh ohh ohh oh
There are no words to describe what I feel
Is what you see
Ohh ohh ohh ohh oh
Till my last breath I shall [?] this painting

Some main life experience
Some minor inconvenience lands to escape
Yes we were born away from each other but
United by the slip of nature
Maybe we need each other to fill the roles we play
Over my part comes the easiest cause I just smile away
Oh now couldn't you see

Ika'y tuwang-tuwa
Panatag ang loob sa damdaming
Ika'y mahal

No'ng nakilala mo ang una mong sinta
Umapaw ang saya at siya'y ibang-iba
Sinasamsam ang bawat gunita

Hindi mo malimutan kung kailan
Nagsimulang matuto kung papaanong magmahal
At di mo malimutan kung kailan mo natikman
Ang una mong halik
Yakap na napakahigpit
Pag-ibig na tunay hanggang langit

No'ng tayo'y nagkakilala ng hindi sinasadya
Ikaw lang ang napansin
Nahuli sa isang tingin
At sa pagbati mong napakalambing

Hindi mo malimutan kung kailan
Nagsimulang matutung ikaw lang ang mahalin
At di ko malimutan kung kailan ko natikman
Ang tamis ng iyong halik
Yakap na napakahigpit
Pag-ibig mong tunay hanggang langit

Hindi mo malimutan kung kailan
Nagsimulang matutung ikaw lang ang mahalin
At di ko malimutan kung kailan ko natikman
Ang tamis ng iyong halik
Yakap na napakahigpit
Pag-ibig mong tunay hanggang langit

The sun'll come out
Tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar
That tomorrow
There'll be sun!

Just thinkin' about
Tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs,
And the sorrow
'Til there's none!

When I'm stuck with the day
That's gray,
And lonely,
I just stick out my chin
And Grin,
And Say,

The sun'll come out
Tomorrow
So ya gotta hang on
'Til tomorrow
Come what may
Tomorrow! Tomorrow!
I love ya Tomorrow!
You're always
A day
A way!

I just stick out my chin

A day

Tomorrow! Tomorrow!
I love ya Tomorrow!

"""Someone's Waiting For You""",Regine Velasquez,"""Hulog Ka Ng Langit""","

Be brave little one
Make a wish for each sad little tear
Hold your head up though no one is near
Someone's waiting for you

Don't cry little one
There'll be a smile where a frown used to be
You'll be part of a love that you see
Someone's waiting for you

Always keep a little pray'r in your pocket
And you're sure to see the light
Soon, there'll be joy and happiness
And your little world will be bright
Have faith little one
'Til your hopes and your wishes come true
You must try to be brave little one
Someone's waiting to love you

Always keep a little pray'r in your pocket
And you're sure to see the light
Soon, there'll be joy and happiness
And your little world will be bright
Have faith little one
'Til your hopes and your wishes come true
You must try to be brave little one
Someone's waiting to love you

Pilitin mang baguhin ang aking nakaraan,
Sa 'yo lang nadama ang pag-ibig na tapat
Sabihin man nilang ika'y hindi nararapat
Ika'y aking hangad
Na makapiling habangbuhay dahil

Araw... liwanang na natatanaw
Ulap... sa yakap mo'y nadarama
Langit.. pag-ibig mo na kay sarap
Tila lumilipad sa t'wing kasama ka
Aking sinta

Kahit talikuran ang mundong pinagmulan
Hindi magsisising ikaw ang pinili
Malaya mang lumisan at 'di na magparamdam
Ito'y 'di gagawin
Kailanma'y 'di kita iiwan dahil

Araw... liwanang na natatanaw
Ulap... sa yakap mo'y nadarama
Langit.. pag-ibig mo na kay sarap
Tila lumilipad sa t'wing kasama ka
Aking sinta

Oh, araw... liwanang na natatanaw
Ulap... sa yakap mo'y nadarama
Langit.. pag-ibig mo na kay sarap
Tila lumilipad
Tanging sa 'yo lang liligaya, dahil

Araw... liwanang na natatanaw
Ulap... sa yakap mo'y nadarama
Langit.. pag-ibig mo na kay sarap
Tila lumilipad sa t'wing kasama ka
Aking sinta

"""The One Real Thing""",Regine Velasquez,"""Hulog Ka Ng Langit""","

Don't be surprise
If you find me in silence
Lost in a dream
Has a gaze into your eyes
All of a word when you near me
You take my breath away
All of the joy
There other thing may bring me
Can never compare to the kind of joy you bring
You always fill me with wonder
You always make my days
I always say
You are the one real thing
That matters in my live
You are the one real thing
In this crazy world of mine
Then I gave up the whole world for
If it's something I had to do
For the one real thing
That matters to me
It's you
Once in a while
I find my self thinking
Never can be any body else like you
You love it's all that I live for
With you I always stay
I always say
You are the one real thing
That matters in my live
You are the one real thing
In this crazy world of mine
That I gave up the whole world for
If it's something I had to do
For the one real thing
That matters to me
It's you
In a world of lies
And a world that make believe
Where dream don't always come true
The one real thing
That make a difference to me
It's you
It's you
Ooooooo...

You are the one real thing
That matters in my live
You are the one real thing
In this crazy world of mine
That I gave up the whole world for
If it's something I had to do
For the one real thing
For the one real thing
For the one real thing
That matters to me
It's you

"""Happiness""",Regine Velasquez,"""Hulog Ka Ng Langit""","

Happiness is finding a pencil
Pizza with sausage
Telling the time
Happiness is learning to whistle
Tying your shoe for the very first time

Happiness is playing the drum in your own school band
And happiness is walking hand in hand

Happiness is two kinds of ice cream
Knowing a secret
Climbing a tree

Happiness is five different crayons
Catching a firefly
Setting him free

Happiness is being alone every now and then
And happiness is coming home again

Happiness is morning and evening
Day time and night time too
For happiness is anyone and anything at all
That's loved by you

Happiness is having a sister
Sharing a sandwich
Getting along

Happiness is singing together when day is through
And happiness is those who sing with you
Happiness is morning and evening
Daytime and nighttime too

For happiness is anyone and anything at all
That's loved by you

"""Hele Ni Inay""",Regine Velasquez,"""Hulog Ka Ng Langit""","

Kay tagal ng panahon
Awit mo'y naririnig
Sa tuwing gabi
Ng paskong tahimik
Tanging tinig mo
Ang nagpapasabik
Na hintayin ko
Dakilang araw sa sasapit

Kay tagal ng panahon
Sa iyo'y nangungulila
Sa bawat haplos
Sa aking mukha
Sa tuwing nahihimbing
Hinihintay pa rin
Maramdaman muli
Ang yakap mo sa akin

Ang tanging hiling
Sa paskong darating
Hele mo inay
Muling marinig
Ang tanging hiling
Sa paskong darating
Sa iyong kandungan
Muling maidlip

At kung matutupad
Ang dasal sa maykapal
Makapiling ka muli
Ng isang sandali
Ang paskong ito'y
'di ko ipagpapalit
Sa lahat ng paskong
Sa aki'y darating

Ang tanging hiling
Sa paskong darating
Hele mo inay
Muling marinig
Ang tanging hiling
Sa paskong darating
Sa iyong kandungan
Muling maidlip

"""You""",Regine Velasquez,"""Hulog Ka Ng Langit""","

You are the one who makes me happy
When everything else turns to gray
Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings
And sends me out into the day

You are the crowd that sits quiet listening to me
And all the mad sense that I make

You are one of the few things worth remembering
And since it's all true
How could anyone mean more to me
Than you?

Sorry if sometimes I look past you
There's no one beyond your eyes
Inside my head the wheels are turning
Hey, sometimes I'm not so wise

You are my heart and my soul, my inspiration
Just like the old love song goes

You are one of the few things worth remembering
And since it's all true
How could anyone mean more to me
Than you?

Beyond your eyes

You're my heart and my soul, my inspiration
Just like the old love song goes

You are one of the few things worth remembering
And since it's all true
How could anyone mean more to me
Than you?
