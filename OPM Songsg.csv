"""(Everybody) Get Down""",Gary Valenciano,"""Interactive""","

Everybody's got to know
If you wanna get up,
You know you gotta get low
Everybody all around
If you wanna get up,
You know you gotta get down

Hey, what's up?
Now do you wanna get goin'?
I can see you movin' up just fine
But when you're there,
Don't you ever forget
All who's been behind you all the time

There's a need to play,
There's a time to pray
There ain't nothin' wrong
why you should do it everyday
It's for everyone to have some fun
What we all need to know
Is that the only way to get up is to get down

Everybody get down
Everybody get down
Get down
Get down, get down
You know the only way to get up is if you get down
Everybody get down

Hey there's nothing wrong if you wanna go on
I know it's your desire, you wanna make it strong
But when the going gets too rough and when you wanna give up
There may be something that you know you gotta do

There's a need to play,
There's a time to pray
There ain't nothin' wrong why you should do this everyday
It's for everyone out to have some fun
What we all need to know
Is that the only way to get up is to get down

Everybody get down
Everybody get down
Get down
Get down, get down
You know the only way to get up is if you get down
Everybody get down

Everybody's got to know
If you wanna get up,
You've gotta gotta get low
Everybody all around
If you wanna get up,
You've gotta first get down

Don't just say it in your mind, say it loud, let Him know
Many times you find what you never thought of before
More precios than silver, more precious than gold,
More than any other treasure you could ever own
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Na na na na na (na na na na na) [x4]

Everybody's got to know
If you wanna get up,
You've gotta get low
Everybody all around
If you wanna get up,
You've gotta, you've gotta get down

Everybody all around
If you wanna get up,
You've gotta get down

Everybody all around
If you wanna get up,
You've gotta get down

Only I, no one else but only I
No one else but only I
Nobody else but I can call her mine
Only I, no one else but only I

Some people call her an angel
The answer to my prayers
She's all this heart of mine desires and knows
They say she's deep as a river
And gracious as the morn
Some people say
She's as lovely as a rose

They call her gentle
They call her true
They call her warm and kind
But only I, only I can call her mine

Some people say she's a candle
Glowing in the dark
They say she's the wind
That blows the clouds away
They say that she's like the sunshine
Through the pouring rain
Her smile can brighten up anybody's day

They call her radiant
They call her bright
They call her a star that shines
But only I, only I can call her mine

Only I have her heart
And only she has mine
Who'd have ever thought
A man like me could be
The one to say
She's with me all the way
The one to say she loves only me (only me)

Some people say she's the best thing
To ever come my way
They say she's a blessing
The best one in my life
They say that she's a jewel
So rare, so hard to find
They call her a wonder
They call her one of a kind

They call her precious
They call her dear
They call her divine
But only I, only I can call her...
The one that I'll love forever
Only I, only I can call her mine
(Only I, no one else but only I)
(No one else but only I)
(Only I, no one else but only I)
Only I, can call her mine

"""More And More""",Gary Valenciano,"""Interactive""","

There's something about the rain when it pours
It gets me thinkin' of you more and more
There's something about the way you are
That takes this empty feeling oh so far

Now I know can't deny what I am feeling
Can I hold you, can I have you a little longer
Can I know you, through my eyes let me tell you
I'm loving you more and more

There's something about the warmth of your touch
That came for a moment yet told me so much
I wish I didn't have to waste all that time
When I made believe that you are mine

Now I know can't deny that I am falling
'Cause I love you, wanna have you by me forever (and ever)
Can I hold you, through my eyes let me tell you
(I'm lovin' you more)

If you knew what I've been going through
Would you feel the same way too
Tell me now what more can I do to get to know you
And open up your heart
Show me where to start
'Cause I'm loving you more and more
(More and more)
More and more
(More and more)

Now I know can't deny that I am falling
('Cause I love you) You should know
I'm lovin' you so
Wanna have you by me forever (and ever)
Can I hold you, through my eyes let me tell you
I'm lovin' you more and more
(Can I know you) You should know
I'm lovin' you so
Wanna have you by me forever (and ever)

Through my eyes let me tell you
I'm loving you more and more...

"""As You Are""",Gary Valenciano,"""Interactive""","

In a world
When nothing seems to matter no more
Where everybody is out to get a little more and more
There you are shining like a star
Every minute of the day
(Showing us the way)
And all that one has got to do
Is call your name and know
That what you were before
You are today will be tomorrow
'Cause you have a soul desire
To share this love with everyone
So when you're down and out and lonely
If you need some lovin' He's got a lot to show
God, He'll never leave
You just got to believe
Don't you go believin' the Devil
He takes pleasure in his lies
Jesus is the giver of life

And He'll just take you as you are
No need to be a hero or a superstar
All your needs are known
He'll make you know
That He is provider
And He'll just take you as you are
Don't you know that He can mend your broken heart
No matter where you've gone
Or what you've done
No, it doesn't matter
('Cause He'll just take you as you are)

You walk around
And show the world that all is alright
Yet not a word is heard about the truth
(You're losing the fight)
Day by day
Taking come what may
Giving in to just 'bout anything and everything and everything
Suddenly things zip from bad to worst
And now you find
You need direction
You need a hand, the loving kind
But He's got a soul desire
To share this love with everyone
So when you gotta get it goin'
He will hear you calling eager to make you know
That He'll never leave
You just got to believe
To the soul of every believer
He takes pleasure in your life
Jesus is the way, the truth and life

And He'll just take you as you are
No need to be a hero or a superstar
All your needs are known
He'll make you know
That He is provider
And He'll just take you as you are
Don't you know that He can mend your broken heart
No matter where you've gone
Or what you've done
No, it doesn't matter
('Cause He'll just take you as you are)

Quit feeling so unworthy
Don't we never really make up too much
Why I feel so alive
It's only because of a Yahweh's touch
[?]
What we've got to do
It's only because of the faithfulness
Of Him we'll promise to

Take you as you are
(No need to be a hero or a superstar)
All your needs are known
He'll make you know
He is provider
And He'll just take you as you are
Don't you know that He can mend your broken heart
No matter where you've gone
Or what you've done
No, it doesn't matter
('Cause He'll just take you as you are)

He'll just take you as you are
No need to be a hero or a superstar
All your needs are known

Minsan sabi niya sa akin sandali na lang
Akala ko naman ay sigurado na ako
Handa kong tanggapin ang kanyang oo
Bigla na lang nagbago ang isip niya
Hindi ko akalain na gano'n pala siya
Pinaasa niya lang ako
Bitin na bitin ako
Oooh woh

Hindi ko na alam kung makakaya ko pa
Di bale na lang kaya
Ako pa ba kaya ang nasa puso niya
Di bale na lang kaya
Ngunit mahal ko siya

Ngayon araw-araw lumilipas ang panahon
Kalimutan ko siya'y malayo sa isip ko
Di kaya, pinaikot niya lang ako
Bigla na naman nagbago ang isip niya
Pagkakataon ko na mapasagot ko siya
Pag ang sinabi ko'y di mabili
Baka mapahiya muli...

Hindi ko na alam kung makakaya ko pa

"""Take Me Out Of The Dark""",Gary Valenciano,"""Interactive""","

Just what is it in me
Sometimes I just don't know
What keeps me in your love
Why you never let me go
And though you're in me now
I fall and hurt you still
My Lord, please show me how
To know just how you feel
'Cause you have forgiven me
Too many times, it seems
I feel I'm not what you might call
A worthy Christian after all
And though I love you so
Temptation finds its way to me

Teach me to trust in you with all of my heart
To lean not on my own understanding
'Cause I just forget
You won't give me what I can't bear
Take me out of the dark, my Lord
I don't wanna be there, no no no more

You've never left my side
You gave your hand to me
To hold, oh Jesus
I'm no longer in the cold
And yet, I leave you there
When I feel satisfied
I'd like to thank you everyday
Not only when I feel this way
I've never known a man
Who'd give his life for sinners like me
And yet because he loves us so
He's promised us eternity
And we can have that promise and be His
If we have faith and just believe

Teach me to trust in you with all of my heart
To lean not on my own understanding
'Cause I just forget
You won't give me what I can't bear
Take me out of the dark, my Lord
'Cause I don't wanna be alone
Take me out of the dark, my Lord
I don't wanna be there, no no
My Lord

Teach me to trust in you with all of my heart
To lean not on my own understanding
'Cause I just forget
That you won't give me what I can't bear
Take me out of the dark, my Lord
'Cause I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be there no more
May your glory be yours, my King, my Lord

Sa hirap ng buhay
Balita ko'y nais mong bumigay
Sa tindi ng problema
Nais mo raw bumitaw
Huwag kang mawawalan ng pag-asa
Hindi ka nag-iisa

Sa hirap at ginhawa
Kaibigan may kasama ka
Kahit na anong pagsubok
Kahit na ano pa'ng dumating
Kahit na kahapon mo'y kay dilim
Araw ay sisikat din

Kaibigan ba't hindi ka magdasal
Isiping laging may nagmamahal
Tunay na magkaibigan
Walang iwanan

Kumulog, bumagyo, makalbo man ang ulo
Lumahar, kumidlat, tumaba o pumayat
Tumanda, bumaha, iwan ka man ng iyong asawa
Hindi ka nag-iisa
Kaibigan may kasama ka
(Kaibigan, may kasama ka)

Malayo man ang pangarap
Maaabot mo rin
Basta't ika'y magsikap
Malayo ang mararating
Huwag lang mawawalan ng pag-asa
Hindi ka nag-iisa

"""Face To Face""",Gary Valenciano,"""Interactive""","

If you let me I will be your shelter
I will be your strength and shield
As you battle in the field alone

There are moments when I sit
And look into this heart that now
You've made your home
Never really understanding
All that you have done
To change this heart
To flesh from stone
It's at these moments when I feel
I'd rather go my way
That I hear your spirit say

Babe won't you stay
Right here with me
I know your burdens
I know all your needs
And when you feel you stand alone
As you battle in the field
I will forever be your strength
Forever be your shield
For the rest of your days
'Til we meet face to face

Day by day I seem to fear the fight
As I do battle with these thoughts in my head
Thinking of what it would be like
For just today to do all that I've often felt
Only one could love somebody with a heart so cold
So lost just like my own
(But you keep on sayin')

Babe won't you stay
Right here with me
I know your burdens
I know all your needs
And when you feel you stand alone
As you battle in the field
I will forever be your strength
Forever be your shield
For the rest of your days
'Til we meet face to face

Sometimes I feel you should just give up on me
'Cause I keep pushin' you to the limit
But you never ever let me go
And with that still small voice
I hear you say to me
Come home
Come home

Babe won't you stay
Right here with me
I know your burdens
I know all your needs
When you feel you stand alone
As you battle in the field
I will forever be your strength
I'll forever be your shield
For the rest of your days
'Til we meet, we meet face to face

If you let me I will be your shelter
I will be your strength and shield...

Show me the way to make you feel right
Never hesitate to give some room for me
Show me the way into your heart tonight
And I'll be there for you my love... girl anytime

So many time it seems through thick and thin we've been
Bumping around messing around almost have called it quits... (but love)
Is always on top of it all thicker and stronger we go
Coz we make a vow to show us how... we're made for one another
You know how much I care for all the things you are
I'm so devoted to you

If you just close your eyes and maybe realize
Running around loosing around
Leaving our cares behind (but life) full or uncertainties
Stress in big quantities we make mistake loosing our faith
But baby never to late...
If we just focus to live and love we will conquer the pain
And have everything to gain...

If you care... if you aware, I'm pulling myself alone
If you dare... love is share, sentimental groove baby
Deep inside my heart, it's just one name it's you
Baby... baby... baby... baby...

Come on baby just show me the way
You got to give me some direction once a while in the day
I can't do this alone, so leave me here on my own
You know it takes two together this lover thing going on
You can trust me girl in this crazy world
You know that no one else but me that can give love before

Yeah... oh so baby baby don't you give it a doubt cause
All the love I feel for you just wanna make me go shout... ohh!

If we focus to live and love
We conquer the pain and have everything to gain...

"""We Are The Reason""",Gary Valenciano,"""Revive""","

As little children, we would dream of Christmas morn
And all our gifts and toys, we knew we'd find,
But we never realized, a baby boy one blessed night
Gave us the greatest gift of our lives.

We are the reason that He gave his life
We are the reason Jesus suffered and died,
To a world that was lost, He gave all he could give
To show us the reason to live.

As the years went by, we learned more of our gifts
And giving of ourselves and what that means,
On a dark and cloudy day, a man hung dying in the rain
Because of love, because of love, because of love...

We are the reason that He gave his life
We are the reason Jesus suffered and died,
To a world that was lost, He gave all he could give
To show us the reason to live,
To live, to live...

Everytime I see the cross
I'm reminded that He gave His life
For you and me...

We are the reason that He gave his life
We are the reason why The Lord suffered and died,
To a world that was lost, He gave all he could give
To show us the reason to live...

We are the reason but He is the reason we live

He promised us that He would be a counselor
A Mighty God and the Prince of Peace
He promised us that He would be a Father
And He would love us with a love that would not cease

Well, I tried Him and I found His promises are true
He's everything He said that He would be
The finest words I know could not begin to tell
Just how much Jesus really means to me

For He's more wonderful than my mind can concieve
He's more wonderful than my heart can believe
He goes beyond my highest hopes and fondest dreams
He's everything that my soul ever longed for
Everything He promised and so much more
More than amazing, more than marvelous
More than miraculous could ever be
He's more than wonderful, that's what Jesus is to me

More than wonderful to me
That's what Jesus is to me
More than wonderful to me

I stand amazed when I think that the King of Glory
Would come to live within the heart of man
Oh, I marvel just to know He really loves me
When I think of who He is and who I am

For He's more wonderful than my mind can concieve
He's more wonderful than my heart can believe
He goes beyond my highest hopes and fondest dreams
He's everything that my soul ever longed for
Everything He promised and so much more
More than amazing, more than marvelous
More than miraculous could ever be
He's more than wonderful, that's what Jesus is to me

He's everything that my soul ever longed for

But even winners can get wounded in the fight
People say that I'm amazing
I'm strong beyond my years
But they don't see inside of me
I'm hiding all the tears

They don't know that I come running home when I fall down
They don't know who picks me up when no one is around
I drop my sword and cry for just a while

Unafraid because His armor is the best
But even soldiers need a quiet place to rest

Our hearts are still the same

Love in any language

Yet look how we're the same
We learn to laugh, to dream our dreams
We know the sting of pain
From Leningrad to Lexington
The farmer loves his land
And daddies get all misty eyed
When they give their daughters' hands
And maybe now we realize
How much there is to share
We have too much in common
To pretend it isn't there

Clapping my hands, look in my eye

To sing our message loud and clear
Looking back we've touched on sorrowful days
Future pass, they disappear

Get down, get down
You know the only way to get up is if you get down

Hey there's nothing wrong if you wanna go on
I know it's your desire, you wanna make it strong
But when the going gets too rough and when you wanna give up
There may be something that you know you gotta do

There's a need to play,
There's a time to pray
There ain't nothin' wrong why you should do this everyday

Get down
Get down, get down
You know the only way to get up is if you get down
Everybody get down

Everybody's got to know
If you wanna get up,
You've gotta gotta get low
Everybody all around
If you wanna get up,
You've gotta first get down

Don't just say it in your mind, say it loud, let Him know
Many times you find what you never thought of before
More precios than silver, more precious than gold,
More than any other treasure you could ever own
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Na na na na na (na na na na na) [x4]

That you'd come back and stay

To ever live a part
I'll wait and see

Someday you'll come to realize
What you and I can be

Then we'll share each other's dreams

At nag tanong anak: ba't ka nagkaganyan

At ang iyong mga mata'y
Biglang lumuha ng 'di mo napapansin

Nalaman mong, ika'y nagkamali

Pagsisisi ang sa isip mo't
Nalaman mong, ika'y nagkamali

Ika'y nagkamali

"""Lift Up Your Hands""",Gary Valenciano,"""Pure Heart""","

Life is not at all that bad my friend, mmm...
If you believe in yourself
If you believe there's someone
Who walks through life with you
You'll never be alone
Just learn to reach out
And open your heart
Lift up your hands to God
And He'll show you the way

And He said
'Cast your burdens upon me
Those who are heavily laden
Come to meall of you who are tired
Of carrying heavy loads
For the yoke I will give you is easy
And My burden is light
Come to Me and I will give you rest.'

When you feel the world is tumbling down on you
And you have no one that you can hold on to
Just face the rising sun and you'll see hope
And there's no need to run
Lift up your hands to God
And He'll make you feel alright

And He said
'Cast your burdens upon me
Those who are heavily laden
Come to me all of you who are tired
Of carrying heavy loads
For the yoke I will give you is easy
And My burden is light
Come to Me and I will give you rest.'

Taglay mo sa bagwis ng iyong paghayo
Ang pangako ng walang hanggang bukas
Pabaon man sayo'y hapdi ng puso
Aabutin ang pangarap

At ang bunga ng wagas mong pagsisikap
Pag-unlad nitong bayang nililiyag
Kapalit ng dalamhati't paghihirap
Pag angat ng kabuhayang marilag.

Liparin mo ang hangganan ng langit
Sa ulap ng pag-asa'y iyong makakamit
Ang tagumpay na bunga ng iyong pagpupunyagi
Pangarap ng inang bayang tinatangi

Tutularan ka ng sunod na salin-lahi
Kapuri-puring pag-aalay ng lakas
Napupugay sa makabagong bayani
Ang buong bansa'y nagpapasalamat

Liparin mo ang hangganan ng langit

Ingatan mo ang lipad ng pangarap
Umaasa sa iyo ang bayan mong naghihintay
Na kamtin mo sa dulo ng lahat ng iyong pagpapagal
Ang tamis na dulot ng iyong... tagumpay...
Ang tamis na dulot ng iyong... tagumpay...

"""Anong Nangyari Sa Ating Dalawa""",Gary Valenciano,No Album,"

Ikaw ang pinangarap
Ikaw ang hanap-hanap
Ngunit bakit nagbago ang lahat
Ang init nang pagmamahal
Parang naging salat

Pangako habang buhay
Nangakong di magwawalay
Ngunit bat lumamig pagmamahal
Parang di na ikaw
Sa maykapal ang dinasal

Anong nangyari sa ating dalawa
Akala ko noon tayo ay iisa
Ako ba ang siyang nagkulang
O ikaw ang di lumaban
Sa pagsubok sa ating pagmamahalan
Anong nangyari sa ating dalawa
Pagmamahal ngayo'y bakit naglaho na
Damdamin ay nasasaktan
Puso'y nasusugatan
Pangako mong pagmamahal ngayon ay nasaan

Nasaan ang sumpaan
Akala ko'y walang hanggan
Ngunit bakit ngayo'y nasasaktan
Hanggang dito na lang ba
Ang ating walang hanggan

Anong nangyari sa ating dalawa
Akala ko noon tayo ay iisa
Ako ba ang siyang nagkulang
O ikaw ang di lumaban

Anong nangyari sa ating dalawa
Pagmamahal ngayo'y bakit naglaho na
Damdamin ay nasasaktan

Pangako mong pagmamahal ngayon ay nasaan

Pipilitin ang sariling tanggapin

Hinahanap hanap ng aking diwang nakapikit

"""Don't Want To See You Cry Again""",Gary Valenciano,No Album,"

I don't want to see you cry again
Miss the pot of gold at rainbow's end
Cease the day you try to fly and fall
I just want to see you standing tall

I don't want to see you cry once more
Careful of the world by shutting doors
Not a bit affected by the crowd
I only want to see you standing proud

Tell me where it hurts and I will ease your pain
Through the stormy hurl I will shield you from the rain
I'm gonna find what's wrong, I'm gonna make it right
Hoping with my song there'll be no need to cry

And though you've shed a thousand tears before
I don't want to see you cry once more
And though it's been a while since your last grin
I just want to see you smile again

Together dreaming dreams of a brighter tomorrow
With hopes from day to day, rid ourselves of the sorrow
Will make this world a better place to live
I don't want to see you cry again

I don't want to see another tear
Knowing that it flows from pain and fear
Rather I will show you to live
Even if it takes my life to give

Tell me where it hurts and I will ease your pain
Through the stormy hurl I will shield you from the rain
I'm gonna find what's wrong, I'm gonna make it right
Hoping with my song there'll be no need to cry

And though you've shed a thousand tears before
I don't want to see you cry once more
And though it's been a while since your last grin
I just want to see you smile again

Together building dreams of a brighter tomorrow
With hopes from day to day, rid ourselves of the sorrow

You looked inside my fantasies
And made each one come true
Something no one else had ever found a way to do
I've kept the memories one by one
Since you took me in
And I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
And I know I'll never love this way again
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on

A fool will lose tomorrow
Reaching back for yesterday
And I won't turn my head in sorrow
If you should go away
I'll stand here and remember
Just how good it's been
And I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
And I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on

"""Make Us Whole Again""",Gary Valenciano,No Album,"

Here we are many are mending their broken hearts
Many are grieving and deeply wounded defeated
From those who've gone with no goodbyes

We've tried to laugh and we cheered we cried
For the selfless warriors who held the line
For you and I for families like yours and mine

We've been through the best and worst of times season after season
When the winds blew hard and the sun refused to shine above us

But we will sing in the storm
And we will dance in the rain
Through we can't come close
And touch all those who now seem so far away

We're not alone in this storm
And we will pray in the rain
No our hearts won't tire
Our faith's on fire
We know our cries are heard from deep within
Can You heal us and make us whole again

Here we stand
Forgive when we don't understand
Take our hands and help us through it to endure it
All that's uncertain and unknown

We've been through the best and worst of times
You've seen us through each season
When the days grew dark
You were there to shine the light to guide us

So we will sing in the storm
And we will dance in the rain
Though we can't come close
And touch all those who now seem so far away

We're not alone in this storm
And we will pray in the rain
No our hearts won't tire
Our faith's on fire
And all our fears are heard from deep within

And we believe that You won't leave us
Cause it's a promise You have made
Even when our hearts get so discouraged there's not one You will forsake
And when the waves leave us battered on the broken roads we've got to take
May we walk the way that leads to You
May it be the choice we make

As we sing in the rain
Maybe then someday we'll have them close
All who seem so far away
We're not alone in this storm
And we will pray in Your name
No our hearts won't tire
Our faith's on fire

We know our tears are in the hands of the one
Who can heal us and make us whole again
Who can make us whole again

"""Spain (I Can Recall)""",Gary Valenciano,No Album,"

Yesterday
Just a photograph of yesterday
And all its edges folded
And the coded faded sepia brown
And yet it's all I have of our past love
A post-script to its ending

Brighter days
I can see such brighter days
When every song we sang is sung again
And now we know
We know this time it's for good
And we're lovers once again
And you're, you're near me
You're near
You're near me

But that's not all

I can remember the rain in December
The leaves were brown falling down
In Spain I did love and adore you
The nights filled with joy were our yesterdays
And the nights were our needs of yearning

I can recall my desire
Every memory is on fire and I get a picture of all our yesterdays
Yes today, I can say
I get a kick every time I see you gaze at me

I can remember the rain in December
The leaves were brown falling down
Our love was a Spanish fiesta
The bright lights and sounds were our joy each day
And the nights were our needs of yearning

I can recall my desire
Every memory is on fire and I get a picture of all our yesterdays
Yes today, I can say
I get a kick every time I see you gaze at me

I see moments of history
Your eyes meet mine
And they dance to the melody
As we live again as if dreaming

The sounds of our hearts beat like castanets
And forever we'll know their meaning

I can recall my desire
Every memory is on fire
And I get a picture of all our yesterdays
Yes today, I can say
I get a kick every time I see you gaze at me

You gaze at me
I see moments of history
Your eyes meet mine and they dance to the melody
As we live again as if dreaming

The sounds of our hearts beat like castanets
And forever we'll know their meaning

I can recall my desire
Every memory is on fire
And I get a picture of all our yesterdays
Yes today, I can say
I get a kick every time I see you gaze at me

You gaze at me
I see moments of history
Your eyes meet mine and they dance to the melody
As we live again oh as if dreaming

The sounds of our hearts beat like castanets
And forever we'll know their meaning

I can remember the rain in December
The leaves were brown falling down
Our love was a Spanish fiesta
The bright lights and sounds were our joy each day
And the nights were our needs of yearning

I can recall my desire
Every memory is on fire
And I get a picture of all our yesterdays
Yes today, I can say
I get a kick every time I see that Spain
Whoa yeah ohh whoa yeah woo...
"
"""Walang Kapalit""",Gary Valenciano,No Album,"

Wag magtaka kung ako ay 'di na naghihintay
Sa anumang kapalit ng inalay kong pag-ibig
Kulang man ang 'yong pagtingin
Ang lahat sa 'yo'y ibibigay kahit 'di mo man pinapansin

Huwag mangamba, hindi kita paghahanapan pa
Ng anumang kapalit ng inalay kong pag-ibig
Sadyang ganito ang nagmamahal
'Di ka dapat mabahala, hinanakit sa 'ki'y walang-wala

At kung hindi man dumating sa 'kin ang panahon
Na ako ay mahalin mo rin
Asahan mong 'di ako magdaramdam kahit ako ay nasasaktan
Huwag mo lang ipagkait na ikaw ay aking mahalin

Huwag mangamba, hindi kita paghahanapan pa
Ng anumang kapalit ng inalay kong pag-ibig
Sadyang ganito ang nagmamahal
'Di ka dapat mabahala, hinanakit sa 'ki'y walang-wala

At kung hindi man dumating sa 'kin ang panahon
Na ako ay mahalin mo rin
Asahan mong 'di ako magdaramdam kahit ako ay nasasaktan
Huwag mo lang ipagkait na ikaw ay aking mahalin

At kung hindi man dumating sa 'kin ang panahon
Na ako ay mahalin mo rin
Asahan mong 'di ako magdaramdam kahit ako ay nasasaktan
Huwag mo lang ipagkait na ikaw ay aking mahalin
