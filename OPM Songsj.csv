"""Grow Old With You""",Jimmy Bondoc,No Album,"

I wanna make you smile
Whenever you're sad
Carry you around
When your arthritis is bad
Oh, all I wanna do
Is grow old with you

I'll get you medicine
When your tummy aches
Build you a fire
If he furnace breaks
Oh, it could be so nice
To grow old with you

I'll miss you
I'll kiss you
I'll give you my coat when you are cold
I need you
I'll feed you
Even let you hold the remote control so

Let me do the dishes
In our kitchen sink
Put you to bed
When you've had too much to drink
Oh, I could be the man
To grow old with you

I'll miss you
I'll kiss you
Give you my coat when you are cold
I need you
I'll feed you
Even let you hold the remote control

I'll miss you
I'll kiss you
Give you my coat when you are cold
I need you
I'll feed you
Even let you hold the remote control

I wanna make you smile
Whenever you're sad
Carry you around
When your arthritis is bad
Oh, all I wanna do
Is grow old with you

I could be the man
To grow old with you

"""Hanggang Dito Na Lang""",Jimmy Bondoc,No Album,"

Akala ko'y habang buhay tayo
Akala ko'y hanggang dulo
Kay haba pa ng kalsada
Dito na ba tayo bababa
Kung ganito na nga bang usapan
Kung dito na ang hangganan
Dapat sigurong iwasan
Ang mga minsang kamustahan

Mga nakasanayan
Dapat ng kalimutan
Upang di tayo magkasakitan

Hanggang dito na lang
Hanggang dito na lang
Ikaw ba ang nagbago
O ako
O tayo
Baka tayo

Hanggang dito na lang
Hanggang dito na lang
Kung tunay ang paalam
Wag ka nang magparamdam
Dahil humihirap lang
Hanggang dito na lang...

Akala ko'y habambuhay ang awit
Akala ko'y hanggang langit
Kay haba pa ng kantahan
Dito na ba tayo tatantan
Kung ganito na nga ang tadhana
Sara'ng pinto at bintana
Dapat sigurong iwasan ang pagkatok sa'ting nakaraan
Mga nakaugalian dapat nang pagbawalan
Sunugin na ang mga larawan

Hanggang dito na lang
Hangang dito na lang
Ikaw ba ang nagbago
O ako
O tayo
Baka tayo

Hanggang dito na lang
Hangang dito na lang
Kung tunay ang paalam
Wag ka nang magparamdam dahil humihirap lang

Hanggang dito na lang
Ang ganda na sana
Bakit biglang nag-iba
Ikaw ba ang nagbago
O ako
O tayo
Baka tayo

Hanggang dito na lang
Hanggang dito na lang
Kung tunay ang paalam wag ka nang magparamdam
Dahil humihirap lang
Hanggang dito na lang

"""I Believe""",Jimmy Bondoc,No Album,"

I believe
Na ikaw lang at ako
Kung kaya't tayo ay pinagtagpo

I believe
Ang kapalaran mo'y ako
At sana ay ganun din ang puso mo

Noong una ay hindi mo ako gusto
Kaibigan lang ang turing mo
Paano na ako

Araw araw maghihintay
Hawak lamang ang sinabi mong
Baka mahal mo rin ako
Tama na sa'kin ang minsa'y
Binigyan mo ng pag-asa
Basta't mahal kita
Ikaw lang at ako ang magsasabi ng I Love You

I Believe
May ibang pangarap ka
At ka'y tagal nating di magkikita

Kung saan
Ka dalhin ng puso mo
Asahan mong ang pag-ibig ko'y sa'yo

Lumipas ang araw at parang kay tagal
Sa mga bituin nakatingin
Kausap ay ikaw

Araw araw maghihintay
Hawak lamang ang sinabi mong
Baka mahal mo rin ako
Tama na sa'kin ang minsa'y
Binigyan mo ng pag-asa
Basta't mahal kita
Ikaw lang at ako ang magsasabi ng I Love You

Ang buhay ko'y ikaw kailanpaman
Kahit tayo'y magkalayo
Tadhana na ang siyang daan
Ng pag-ibig mo'y maramdaman
Basta't ito ang pangako ko

Araw araw maghihintay
Hawak lamang ang sinabi mong
Baka mahal mo rin ako
Tama na sa'kin ang minsa'y
Binigyan mo ng pag-asa
Basta't mahal kita
Ikaw lang at ako ang magsasabi ng I Love You
Ikaw lang at ako ang magsasabi ng I Love You

"""Let Me Be The One""",Jimmy Bondoc,No Album,"

Somebody told me you were leavin'
I didn't know
Somebody told me you're unhappy
But it doesn't show

Somebody told me that you don't want me no more, no
So you're walkin' out the door

Nobody told me you've been cryin'
Every night
Nobody told me you'd been dyin'
But didn't want to fight

Nobody told me that you fell out of love from me
So I'm settin' you free

Let me be the one to break it up
So you won't have to make excuses
We don't need to find a set up where
Someone wins and someone loses

We just have to say our love was true
But has now become a lie
So I'm tellin' you I love you one last time
And goodbye

Somebody told me you still love me
I don't know why
Nobody told me that you only
Needed time to fly

Somebody told me that you want to come back when
Our love is real again

Let me be the one to break it up
So you won't have to make excuses
We don't need to find a set up where
Someone wins and someone loses

We just have to say our love was true
But has now become a lie
So I'm tellin' you I love you one last time
And goodbye

Just turn around and walk away
You don't have to live like this, no, no
But if you love me still then stay
Don't keep me waiting for that final kiss

We can work together through this test
Or we can work through it apart
I just need to get this off my chest
That you will always have my heart

Let me be the one

Let me be the one to break it up
So you won't have to make excuses
We don't need to find a set up where
Someone wins and someone loses

We just have to say our love was true
But has now become a lie
So I'm tellin' you I love you one last time
And goodbye

"""Yaya""",Jimmy Bondoc,No Album,"

May pag-ibig pa palang ganto
Tila sumusubaybay ang buong mundo
Bawat tingin, bawat sulyap
Walang bawal sa pangarap
May wakas ba ang hiwagang kay sarap

Yaya-yain kita
Sa tamang panahon, sa altar ng Poon
Yaya-kapin kita
Kung hindi man ngayon,
darating tayo do'n
Kung mahal mo ako
at mahal din kita
Balang-araw tayo ring dalawa

Kahit pader, di tayo mapaghiwalay
Kahit matatanda'y di tayo masaway
Bawat puso'y sumisigaw
Hinihintay lang ang araw
na kahit 'sang saglit, ikaw ay matanaw

Yaya-yain kita
Sa tamang panahon, sa altar ng Poon
Yaya-kapin kita
Kung hindi man ngayon,
sa madaling panahon
Kung mahal mo ako
at mahal din kita
Balang-araw tayo ring dalawa

Kung may hahadlang man sa pagmamahalan
Wag mag-alala, puso ko'y sa'yo lamang
Panahon natin ito
Bakit natin isusuko
Balang-araw, alaala natin ito

Yaya-yain kita
Sa tamang panahon, sa altar ng Poon
Yaya-kapin kita
Kung hindi man ngayon,
Sa madaling panahon
Kung mahal mo ako
at mahal din kita
Balang-araw tayo ring dalawa
(Balang araw sinta)
Kung mahal mo ako
at Mahal din kita
Balang araw tayo ring dalawa

"""Ika'y Mahal Pa Rin""",Jovit Baldivino,No Album,"

Kailangan ba na magwakas itong pag-ibig
Bukas kaya'y wala kana sa king isip
Hindi mo ba naalalang mga kahapon
Na dati ay anong saya't anong tamis

Sadyang pag-ibig natin ay nakakapanghinayang
Ngunit sa ting mga mata ito'y kalabisan lamang
Patuloy lang masasaktan ang mga puso
O bakit kay sakit pa rin ng paglayo

Wala ka man ngayon sa aking piling
Nasasaktan man ang puso't damdamin
Muli't muli sa âyo na aaminin
Ika'y mahal pa rin

At kung sa kali na muling magkita
At madama na mayro'n pang pag-asa
Hindi na natin dapat pang dayain
Hayaan natin puso ang magpasya

Wala na bang puwang sayo ang aking puso
Wala na bang ganap ang dating pagsuyo
Mali ba ang maging tapat sa mga pangako
Sa atin aang lahat kaya'y isang laro

Sadyang pagibig natin ay nakakapanghinayang
Ngunit sa âting mga mata ito'y kalabisan lamang
Patuloy lang masasaktan ang mga puso
O bakit kay sakit pa rin ng paglayo

Wala ka man ngayon sa aking piling
Nasasaktan man ang puso't damdamin
Muli't muli sa âyo na aaminin
Ika'y mahal pa rin

At kung sa kali na muling magkita
At madama na mayro'n pang pag-asa
Hindi na natin dapat pang dayain
Hayaan natin puso ang magpasya

Wala ka man ngayon sa aking piling
Nasasaktan man ang puso't damdamin
Muli't muli sa âyo na aaminin
Ika'y mahal pa rin

At kung sa kali na muling magkita
At madama na mayro'n pang pag-asa
Hindi na natin dapat pang dayain
Puso ang magpapasya
Wala ka man ngayon sa aking piling
Nasasaktan man ang puso't damdamin
Muli't muli sa âyo na aaminin
Ika'y mahal pa rin

"""Mula Sa Puso""",Jovit Baldivino,No Album,"

Bakit nga ba ang puso
Pag nagmamahal na
Ay sadyang nakapagtataka
Ang bawa't sandali
Lagi nang may ngiti
Dahil langit ang nadarama
Para bang ang lahat ay walang hangganan
Dahil sa tamis na nararanasan
Kung mula sa puso ay tunay ngang ganyan

Nais ko'y ikaw ang laging yakap-yakap
Yakap na sana'y walang wakas
Sana'y laging ako ang iniisip mo
Sa maghapon at sa magdamag

Init ng pag-ibig ating pagsaluhan
Kung mayroong hahadlang
'Di ko papayagan
Kung mula sa puso ay tunay ngang ganyan

Nais ko'y ikaw ang laging yakap-yakap
Yakap na sana'y walang wakas
Sana'y laging ako ang iniisip mo
Sa maghapon at sa magdamag

Init ng pag-ibig ating pagsaluhan
Kung mayroong hahadlang
Aking paglalaban
Kung mula sa puso ay tunay ngang ganyan
Kung mula sa puso ay tunay ngang ganyan

"""Pusong Bato""",Jovit Baldivino,No Album,"

Nang ika'y ibigin ko
Mundo ko'y biglang nagbago
Akala ko ika'y langit
Yun pala'y sakit ng ulo
Sabi mo noon sa 'kin
Kailan may di mag babago
Naniwala naman sa'yo
Ba't ngayo'y iniwan mo

Di mo alam dahil sa'yo
Ako'y di makakain
Di rin makatulog
Buhat ng iyong lokohin
Kung ako'y muling iibig
Sana'y di maging katulad mo
Tulad mo nama'y pusong bato

Kahit san ka man ngayon
Dinggin mo itong awitin
Baka sakaling ikay magising
Ang matigas mong damdamin

Di mo alam dahil sa'yo
Ako'y di makakain
Di rin makatulog
Buhat ng iyong lokohin

"""The Side Character""",Janine Berdin,"""WTF I actually wrote these songs""","

I'm at the bottom of the list
I'm not the type to take a risk
You see my name and ask, ""who's this?""
Perfect example of it is what it is

My only goal's to do no wrong
Whichever is I'll go along
Bury my thoughts in all my songs ('cause)
My music is where I belong

And if we meet eyes
Look away and pass by
I'm not worth the time, go with the flow

Cus I make sure that I
Don't stand out cus I'm
Afraid to go and break the status quo

I'm mediocre, I'm a bore
I'm the first knight to die in a war
A side character, nothing more
If not extraordinary, what am I here for?

You on your worst day is my best
A look at you and I'm depressed
Stuck in a cycle of a medieval quest
Nah, I'm really just a mess

Yeah I make sure that I
Don't stand out cus I'm
Afraid to go and break the status quo

Cus when I'll choose to try
To word out all my rhymes
I still won't get the lead for the whole show

Ay, hehe, sorry

I'm mediocre, I'm a bore
I'm the first knight to die in a war
A side character, nothing more
If not extraordinary, what am I here for?

I'm mediocre, I'm a bore
I'm the first knight to die in a war
A side character, nothing more
I'm not extraordinary, what am I here for

If this were a movie
Then I'd understudy
The fifth extra crossing the street

Wish I were the main the girl
The center of your world
A wish is a dream that can't be

I'm sorry that I'm me
I'm sorry that I'm me
I'm sorry that I'm positively negative and weak

But I'm happy that I'm me
I'm glad that I am me
I'd rather be the supporting role who's pretty cute and meek

How much I wish I could be her
You don't know
You'll never see me

Wrapped your lies with a big pretty bow
Booze and sly jokes to make her feel ready

Kaliwa't kanan ang pag daing
Sarili ay nilulugmok
Sa isanng daang yardang puti
Mas kita mopa ang tuldok

Oras ay wag sayanging
Sa walang kapararakan
Iisa lang ang buhay mo
Gamitin moto ng husto

Sino sino sino sinong panalo?

Wag mo sanang ipagwalang bahala
Imulat mo ang isip at diwa
Sa isang iglap nandito ka
Walang hindi magagawa

Ang buhay natin ay isang himala
Wag kang malunod sa pag aalala
Wag mong isipin na ika'y walang wala

Walang saysay ang pagmukmok

Dika dika dika dika kawawa!

Bigat ng yong pasanin, sa Diyos ipaubaya

Para dika na mahulog
Lilipas din ang yong tulog

Bulalakaw ko, ang paglabay mo gipangandoy ko
Bulalakaw ko, dungga kining pangandoy ko

Lumilitaw ang mga bituin, kaya maghihintay ako

Palaging maghihintay

Kahit na sa maikling sandali
Oh, bulalakaw ng gabing ito
Ligaya ka ng puso kong nalulumbay

Oh, bulalakaw, sa iyong pagdaan
Ang balisang puso'y napapanatag
Ang iyong ilaw ay aking pag-asa
Ilaw sa kadiliman
Kaya ako'y maghihintay

Palaging maghihintay

Christmas puddings rich with Christmas cream

Christmas presents shine in the Christmas windows
Christmas boxes tied with pretty bows
Wonder what's inside
What delights they hide
But till Christmas morning no one knows
Won't it be exciting if it snows?

I suppose that children everywhere
Will say a Christmas prayer
Till Santa brings their Christmas things

Christmas children hunger for Christmas morning
Christmas day's a wonder to behold
Wondrous things to eat
Every Christmas treat
I believe that story we've been told
Christmas is for children young and old

Little Christmas tree
No one to buy you, give yourself to me
You're worth your weight in precious gold, you see
My little Christmas tree

Promise you will be
Nobody else's little Christmas tree
I'll make you sparkle, just you wait and see
My little Christmas tree

I'll put some tinsel in your hair
And you'll find that there's a strange new change
That you have never seen
I'll bring my boy a toy
He'll jump for joy
To see his bright new queen

With me you will go far
I'll show Saint Nick the tree you really are
And there'll be peace on Earth when Daddy lights your star

"""When A Child Is Born""",Jose Mari Chan,"""Christmas In Our Hearts""","

A ray of hope flitters in the sky
A shiny star lights up way up high
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds have changed whisperin the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A rosy fume settles all around
Youve got the feel youre on solid ground
For a spell or two no-one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born

[spoken:]
And all of this happened
Because whe world is waiting
Waiting for one child
Black, white, yellow, no one knows
But a child that would grow up and turn tears to laughter
Hate to love, war to peace
And everyone to everyones neighbour
Misery and suffering would be forgotten forever

Its all a dream and illusion now
It must come true, sometimes soon somehow
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

When a child is born

Slowly the light unfolding
Softly the dawn approaching
Anxious frightened souls
Seeking hope, seeking hope

Stumbling through sad desolation
Wondering with frightened confusion
Towards a dark gaping tomb
A buried hope

Gently, an awareness of a loving presence
His words, Do not be afraid
His message, Peace be with you
Rabbi! Remember, it is the Lord

At the tempest and the storm
In the kindnesses that keep us warm
Even through the pains and betrayals
Of life's crucifixion

Rejoice, dear souls
For peace, it is the Lord
Soothe, it is the Lord
It is the Lord, now and forever
Amen

And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us

But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
The power and the glory
Now and forever, Amen
For thine is the kingdom
The power and the glory
Now and forever, Amen

"""Count Your Blessings (Instead Of Sheep)""",Jose Mari Chan,"""Christmas In Our Hearts""","

When I'm worried and I can't sleep
I count my blessings instead of sheep
And I fall asleep counting my blessings

When my bankroll is getting small
I think of when I had none at all
And I fall asleep counting my blessings

I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads
And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds

If you're worried and you can't sleep
Just count your blessings instead of sheep
And you'll fall asleep counting your blessings

And (you'll) I'll fall asleep counting my blessings

I thank the Lord for good health
For the gift of love He sends
But most of all He's blessed me
With my family and friends

When you feel that you're down and out
Just count your blessings, I have no doubt
You'll soon be on your feet, counting your blessings

Couldn't help but notice your smile
While everybody else around us is going about
Can we just stop and talk awhile?

I've been often told our world's growing old
And that friends are harder to find
Do tell me more about yourself
We could share a thought or two
Now who would mind?

Maybe then we could go for a ride
Drive down to the countryside
Get away from the gray
And frenzied hurly-burly of the city life

Early yet to say what lies ahead
It's the first day of the rest of our lives
Can we just stop and talk awhile
Get to know each other
Who are we to know?
Love could be waiting at the end
'Round that bend and so
Let's stop and talk awhile

"""Christmas Past""",Jose Mari Chan,No Album,"

The sound of bells at early dawn
Like music from afar
Soft gentle breeze, the world at peace
A solitary star

Those joyful hymns and warm hellos
The candycanes and colored bows
All these and love are memories of
My Christmas past

Those wondrous toys of girls and boys
The cheer that Santa brings
That glorious tale of sheperd boys
Of angels and of kings

A christmas tree with lights aglow
Some cotton snow and mistletoe
All these and love are memories of
My Christmas past

Silver and gold, red and green
Colors of a wonderful scene
Memories they keep returning
And I'm like a child again

If there's a place in time and space
Where christmas past has gone
I'll surely try if I could fly
To see that early dawn

And share again that Christmas past
With all those who have gone
But those memories will forever live
Within my heart

"""Constant Change""",Jose Mari Chan,No Album,"

We're on the road
We move from place to place
And oftentimes when I'm about to call it home
We'd have to move along
Life is a constant change...

The friends we know we meet along the way
Too soon the times we share form part of yesterday
'Cause life's a constant change
And nothing stays the same, oh no

Clouds that move across the skies
Are changing form before our very eyes

Why couldn't we keep time from movin' on?
Hold on to all the years before this moment's gone?
Why must we live the days at such a frightening pace?

We're all like clouds that move across the skies
And changing form before our very eyes

Have we outgrown our Peter Pans and wings?
We've simply grown too old for tales of knights and kings
'Cause life's a constant change
And nothing stays the same, oh no

Setting the world aglow
Christmas is blessing some old, lonely place

Carols that float in the air day and night
And candles that burn with a warm, friendly light
But more, even more than all the above, I know this is true

Each day of the year can be Christmas
If love is the gift from you

When the season comes to an end
And the New Year's just round the bend
Though they'll take down the tree as always
And the bright trimming of the hallways
Christmas will linger for all days
Let love be the gift from you

Empty people filled with care
Headed who knows where

On they go through private pain
Living fear to fear
Laughter hides their silent cries
Only Jesus hears

People need the Lord, people need the Lord
At the end of broken dreams, He's the open door
People need the Lord, people need the Lord
When will we realize people need the Lord

We are called to take His light
To a world where wrong seems right
What would be too great a cost
For sharing life with one who's lost

Through His love our hearts can feel
All the grief they bear
They must hear the words of life
Only we can share

People need the Lord, people need the Lord
At the end of broken dreams, He's the open door
People need the Lord, people need the Lord
When will we realize that we must give our lives

Down the high and bi-ways of my days
Music of your laughter fills my every dream
Like a love song from long ago
Never ending streams of faces come and go
Million different people all around
No use searching for I'll never find you there
For you are far beyond compare

Take a jet to a hide-away
From the hum-drum of everyday

She asked about you
I didn't quite know what to say
Heard you've been making
The rounds 'round here
While I've been trying to make tears disappear
Now I'm almost over you
I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around
After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you

Your such a sly one
With your cold cold heart
Maybe leaving can ease it
But it tore me apart
Time heals all wounds they say
And I should know
Coz it seems like forever
But I'm letting you go

Now I'm almost over you
I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around
After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you

I can't forgive you and sooner forget
All my shattered dreams
Although you left me with nothing to show
All my miseries

Now I'm almost over you

There'll be no more wars
And the children will play

Treat people the same
Stop with the violence
Down with the hate

Yakap at mga halik ay nadarama pa rin

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

In the cool breeze of December
Sparkling lights, all over town

By the Christmas tree
A shower of stardust on your hair

If there's one thing
In my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool
And bright clear water
Lots of those friendly people
They're showing me ways to go
And I never want to
Lose their inspiration

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

Well, I was born in the sign of water
And it's there that I feel my best
The albatross and the whales
They are my brothers
It's kind of a special feeling
When you're out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

I've never been romantic
And sometimes, I don't care
I know it may sound selfish

Come on over, and let our love begin

I did my best
But I guess my best wasn't good enough
'Cause here we are back where we were before
Seems nothing ever changes
We're back to being strangers
Wondering if we oughta stay
Or head on out the door

Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong
Why we never last for very long
What are we doing wrong
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right
Make the magic last for more than just one night
If we could just get to it
I know we could break through it

I gave my all
But I guess my all may have been to lose
'Cause Lord knows we're not getting anywhere
Seems we're always blowing whatever we got going
And seems at times with all we've got
We haven't got a prayer

Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong
Why the good times never last for very long
Whatever we got going
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right

Just once I want to understand
Why it always come back to good-bye
Why can't we get ourselves in hand
And admit to one another
That we're no good with out each other
Take the best and make it better
Find a way to stay together

Most of the time there's just no telling when
Look up and see you've got me

"""Maybe This Time""",Jaya,"""Real Love Stories""","

Two old friends meet again
Wearin' older faces
And talk about the places they've been
Two old sweethearts who fell apart
Somewhere long ago
How are they to know
Someday they'd meet again
And have a need for more than reminiscin'

Maybe this time
It'll be lovin' they'll find
Maybe now they can be more than just friends
She's back in his life
And it feels so right
Maybe this time, love won't end

It's the same old feeling back again
It's the one that they had way back when
They were too young to know when love is real
But somehow, some things never change
And even time hasn't cooled the flame
It's burnin' even brighter than it did before
It got another chance, and if they take it...

Maybe this time
It'll be lovin' they'll find
Maybe now they can be more than just friends
She's back in his life
And it feels so right
Maybe this time, love won't end

She's smilin' like she used to smile way back then
She's feelin' like she used to feel way back when
They tried, but somethin' kept them
Waiting for this magic moment

Maybe this time
It'll be lovin' they'll find
Maybe now they can be more than just friends
She's back in his life
And it feels so right
Maybe this time...
Maybe this time
Maybe this time love won't end

In search of a star
You are that star
You're the one I've waited for

Is all I'm asking
All of the minutes and the years
All of your happiness

Love can be ours if we want it
Starting tonight every dream I ever knew
Here in your arms I'm believing
Finally my life has a meaning of its own
Here in the land of loving I am home

I was alone in the city
Searchin' for someone to find me
Cold empty nights and a million strangers' eyes
Here in your arms I'm beginning
To leave behind all the loneliness I knew
Here in the land of loving there is you

In this simple room magic is made
Though the world seems unchanged
Leave the lights on I'm a bit afraid
This might be just a sweet dream

Deep in the night love is growing
Though I had no way of knowing
That when I found you I found everything I need
Here in your love I'll be staying
Finally my life won't be living all alone
Here in the land of the loving I am home

She'll keep believing
Keep believing
She'll keep on believing

In her miracle child
Her dark and curly-haired miracle child
Singing to a mirror
Just a child at play
To those unknowing how someday

This miracle child
Grown up and grateful miracle child
Would sing to a crowd of many
About how any child at play could really be

A dream unfolding before our eyes
A dream come true to those who realize
That anybody
Anybody
Anybody could be

A miracle child
Just like this miracle child
One mother's miracle child
Believe, oh believe
In every miracle child

"""Away From You""",Jaya,No Album,"

There were times that I just wanna cry with all the strain
There were moments of uncertainty and pain
But when you are there to help and care I smile again
But here am I so alone away from you

Everyday I can only pray
For your warm, lovin' arms
To take me away from all the emptiness, despair
Why do I have to be away from you

I have searched throughout the world a lot of things I've seen
I have pondered many possibilities
Then you come along, you make me strong so stay with me
Why am I on my own without you

On my own so far away I long from your warm lovin' arms
Into the cold, dark emptiness of hurt, despair
I don't wanna be away from you

Everyday I can only pray for your warm, lovin' arms
To take me away from all the emptiness, despair
Why do I have to be away from you

Please don't let me be

On my own so far away I long from your warm lovin' arms
Into the cold, dark emptiness of hurt, despair
I don't wanna be away from you

Everyday I can only pray for your warm, lovin' arms
To take me away from all the emptiness, despair
Why do I have to be away from you

On my own so far away I long from your warm lovin' arms
Into the cold, dark emptiness of hurt, despair
I don't wanna be away from you

And if perfection was minutes yeah you'd go on for hours

So come take my hand and be with me I'll love you forever

You look at me with your hazel eyes
I can't believe, it took me by surprise
I thought I had it all figured out just fine

You had your plans and they were more than this
You're all prepared, you even got a list
But if you need to, you can take up all of my time

And I don't know how to tell you my intentions to fix in your heart
And the only thing that I can do is take you back to the start

So here I am, looking at your beginning
After the world has sent you spinning around
So here I am, I thought that I would be leaving
But your words, they've got me missing you now

You told me all the things you gonna do
You found someone, I hope he loves you too
I only want the very best in life for you

Dont you worry, I'll be right here if you need me to fix your heart
You don't have to think about me but I hope we'd never drift apart

So here I am, looking at your beginning
After the world has sent you spinning around
So here I am, I thought that I would be leaving
But your words, they've got me missing you now

Look at me, it'll be alright, I promise you
If you need to take my hand, I won't let go

I've been dreaming, dreaming
Every night I think about you crying, crying
Don't know what to say when you are losing, losing, losing your mind
I keep thinking, thinking
I should've hold you close when you were crying, crying
Didn't think I'll be the one who's losing, losing, losing my mind

After the world has sent you spinning around

As you walk down the aisle
I should give me that smile
As I watch your mother cry
Her princess is a grown up girl now

As you look me in the eye
As I look back in time
Back when I never knew you
Never thought that you will be mine now

We were just strangers
Two different people
Never knew of your existence
Now we are together

Cuz you made me believe in forever
You kept me warm in my cold December
You will be mine, and I'll be yours
Until the end of time, and I
As I kiss your lips
While I close my eyes
I will fall in love again with you
With you

When we get back home
I'll give you the remote control
And you can lay your head
As we watch your favorite show
I'll spend time with you
Pillow fight until the night falls
Maybe get drunk with you
And do some stuff we should not do

We were just strangers
Two different people
Never knew of your existence
Now we are together

Cuz you made me believe in forever
No, you kept me warm in my cold December
You will be mine, and I'll be yours

White lines falling from the sky
Tricks of light that pass us by
No need to talk, I know you feel it
Pens and needles we afraid
Since you wrap around my head
How bad can it be?
When you're not here with me?

It's just too much nights I spend alone
Staring at the telephone
Too much pens I put on hold
Too much questions I don't know
Too much voices in my head
Wishing it was you instead
Too much things that I will do
'Cuz I can't get too much of you

So many times I've wondered
Do we have to wait so long
Am I coming on too strong
Honestly it seems to be in short supply
But I'd do anything to find
Just a little peace of mind
But there's just one thing
You've got me questioning

Kaso nang sumakay ako ng taxi ay para bang tila iba
Ang tingin sakin ng mama na sa manibela malayo akong dinala
Nung tanungin ko teka muna pare ay bigla na lamang syang natawa
Nag-iba'ng aking kaba teka bakit may pumasok pa na dalawa
Hanggang hinawakan ako sa balikat ng isa na may tangan na patalim
Pilit inaagaw ang dala kong bag na pinakatatago ko ng palihim
Dahil ang laman nito ay ang lahat ng mga araw na ako'y nakatingin
Sa bituin kahit madilim pero bakit sa dulo ako pa rin kahit gawin

Baba, naalala mo pa?
Noong ginusto natin mag drive
Papuntang Tagaytay

Pagdating, mga kainan ay sarado na
Kaya sa 7-eleven
Bibili ng pagkain
At tayo'y maghahanap ng parking
Sa likod ng kotse matutulog

Tayo ay lalalalamigin
Pero okay lang init ng katawan natin ating kumot

Kung pwede ko lang balikan ang ating nakaraan
Noong nandyan pa ang kislap sa iyong mata
Kung pwede ko lang balikan o dun na ako titira
Konting tiis na lang
Ang time machine hahanapin ko pa

Baba, naalala mo ba?
Nuong tayo'y masaya at ang buhay simple pa
Sa mga pangarap ko ay kasama ka
At sa mga pangarap mo
Andun din ako diba

Shet!
Ano ba ang nangyari?
Bakit bigla kang nagbago?

Sino na ang hahawak ng iyong birthday cake?
At sino na ang iyong ka-date sa Tomas Morato?

Kung pwede ko lang balikan ang ating nakaraan
Nung andyan pa ang kislap sa iyong mata
Kung pwede ko lang balikan O dun na ako
Titira ko konting tiis na lang

Dun ba sa macho na gwapo?
Kung yun lang ang gusto mo?

"""Never Bring Me Down""",Jed Madela,"""Superhero""","

Sitting here alone, I close my eyes
All I hear are whispers in the dark
I'm on the ground waiting for a hand
But it seems it is impossible to stand
I will stand up, open up my eyes and find the light
Somehow, I'll find my way to get through it all
Open up my eyes and find the light
I just have to believe
So tell me ""Get up cause you're strong""

I will stand up
And make them see
I'm more than what they think of me
When the world has turned their back on me
I will fly...
And they will never bring me
They will never bring me down

Ohhh... (Never bring me down...)
They will never bring me down...
Ohhh... (Never bring me down...)
They will never bring me down...
Ohhh... (Never bring me down...)
They will never bring me down...
Ohhh...
Say whatever what you want to say
Do whatever what you want to do
There's nothing they can take away from me, no
As long as I know that my heart is true

I will stand up
And make them see
I'm more than what they think of me
When the world has turned their back on me
I will fly...
And they will never bring me
They will never bring me down

Sticks and stones, they'd break my bones
But words they never hurt me
I may bleed and I may bruise
But I'll come out strong, just you wait and see.
Slap my face and hit me hard
I'll come out strong!
I will stand up
And will make them see
I'm more than what they think of me

I will stand up
And make them see
I'm more than what they think of me
When the world has turned their back on me
I will fly...
And they will never bring me
They will never bring me down

Ohhh... (Never bring me down...)
They will never bring me down...
Ohhh... (Never bring me down...)
They will never bring me down...
Ohhh... (Never bring me down...)
They will never bring me down...

I think I could be the man of steel
But too shy to wear undies outside my tights
If I could be a superhero
I wonder which I'd be

What if I could be like Spiderman
Spinning webs, climbing walls, and saving men
If I could be a superhero
I wonder which I'd be

If there were bags of magic dust for sale
I would be the first to order it by mail
I'd cross the sea myself by sail
I'd lay my hands for a broken rail

I know there is more to just being me
I know deep inside there is more to me
Cause I'm more than a superhero
More than a superhero

I know I am more than this skin or hair
More than the biceps more than the power stare
I could strongly feel my purpose in my life
I am super not just a hero in me

I don't care if other people say
That I'm just obsessed with make-believe
I just want to make a difference
While I got the strength to live

It's just not enough to sit down and let things be
'Coz I can start the change that I want to see
I'm more than just the typical hero
From the realm of the mystical or supernatural

Oh, how I wished that time would stop even just for a while

All we had were borrowed minutes,
But how can something so wrong feel so right?

I know it's hard to turn my back and let you go
And I can't help but cry
But I just have to breathe then close my eyes
And think that you were mine even just for a while

Now I'm all alone in this cold and empty room
I remember how you would hold me tight the whole night through
But now the nights seem so much longer
Now that you're not here, it gets harder,
I thought we would be together for some time...

It breaks my heart, to see you when you cry
If only I could hold you one more time

There is nothing
Nothing's impossible
Have a little faith and be strong, be invincible
Move a mountain and touch the sky
Nothing can stop me from living my dream and believing
I see it with my eyes
It will happen
Slowly unfolding
Been waiting so patiently for this moment to come
No regret, with every breath
Faith will not falter

Walked through it all
Been through the rise & fall
Crawled up through the cracks
And no turning back
I'm broken and scarred but I've won
The greatest fight of my life

If I ever stumble in trouble I will not fumble,
I'll rise from the rubble cause life's always tough but
His grace never stops
No one can keep me from living my dream and believing
I see it with my eyes
It will happen
Slowly unfolding
Been waiting so patiently for this moment to come
No regret, with every breath
Faith will not falter

Walked through it all
Been through the rise & fall
Crawled up through the cracks
And no turning back
I'm broken and scarred but I've won
The greatest fight of my life

The sun it may set and
Raindrops keep falling
But in the end of it all I know
Something is waiting for me
His love is enduring
Catching me each time I fall

Walked through it all
Been through the rise & fall
Crawled up through the cracks
And no turning back
I'm broken and scarred but I've won
The greatest fight...

You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?

The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

Didn't we almost have it all?
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all?
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?

Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new?
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The love of me and you?
Cause we'll never ever gonna lose it again
'Cause once you know what love is
You never let it end

Didn't we almost have it all?
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all?
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?

Got a letter in the mail today
And I'm glad you;re doin' fine
You tell me you're missing me
And it's cold in New York City

We and the kids we're alright
Thinking about you night after night
And if you feel the same way too
Just imagine me whispering to you

Everyday I'll always love you
Everyday I'm always thinking of you
Everyday's another lonely day without you
Everyday you'll here beside me
Everyday I'm always dreaming of you
Everyday I will be right here waiting for you

It's another long and sleepless night
And thoughts run through my mind
Guess I'm just feeling lonely
It's been so empty since you've been gone

I'll holding on for it won't be long
I'll be counting the days till I see you home
I know you feel the way I do
So just remember those words I'll say to you

Everyday I'll always love you

That is why I sing

And saw one shining bright

"""Love Always Finds A Way""",Jed Madela,No Album,"

We've said it all
A thousand times before
I've been to the wall
And always found somewhere to turn
There was always more to learn

We've reached the end
And almost closed the door
And someone went in
I never can remember who
All i know is that
We found the strength to make it through

Love always finds a way
When the clouds have no silver linings
She comes through shining
Love always seeks the light
Through the darkest night
In her small ways
Love always finds a way

Holding you near
After the storm has passed
It becomes clear
When all our tears have finally dried
That no matter how we fools
May try to turn the tide

Love always finds a way
When the clouds have no silver linings
She comes through shining
Love always seeks the light
Through the darkest night
In her small ways
Love always finds a way

And in those moments when
The magic seems to fade
We must remember then
That's the time to keep on believing
And not be afraid

If we can trust
In what we really feel
The two of us
Can hold tomorrow in our hands
All it takes is just a faith
That truly understand that...

Love always finds a way
When the clouds have no silver linings
She comes through shining
Love always seeks the light
Through the darkest night
In her small ways
Love always finds a way

I see you, beside me
It's only a dream
Wishing a part you'll still be
The laughter, the sorrow
Pictures in time
Fading to memory
How could I ever let you go
Isn't too late to let it show

That I come to run from your side
But this place I hide
It only reminds me of you
When I turn out of the light
Even the night
It only reminds me of you

I needed my freedom
This what I've thought
But I was a fool to believe
My heart breaks while you cry
Rivers of tears
But I was too blind to see
How could I ever let you go
Isn't too late to let you show

That I come to run from your side
But this place I hide
It only reminds me of you
When I turn out of the light
Even the night
It only reminds me of you

Only you...

Please come back to me
I'm down on my knees
God give me strength...

That I come to run from your side
But this place I hide
It only reminds me of you
When I turn out of the light
Even the night

To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear the unbreakable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong
And to love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest
To follow that star
No matter how hopeless
No matter how far

To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march
March into hell for a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable
The unreachable, the unreachable star
And I'll always dream
The impossible dream
Yes and I'll reach
The unreachable star

I guess I'd like to just lie down and smile
When I'm dreaming about you before
My eyes, your picture on my wall
And when I feel like I would like to read
Your letters over and over again
Because ""I love you""

Anywhere I go
Babe I would like you to know
That I can't stand
Being alone without you
So what I always do
Is think about you

Hey, yeah

I'd like to call you on the phone
Even though we've talked a while ago
It seems so clear to me
That I miss you so badly
And then I'd like to grab my pen and paper
To send this message to you
Saying that ""I miss you""

Ooh
Or maybe I would just call your name (just call my name)
Perhaps the wind will whisper into your ears
Or I'll just look at the sky
And just gaze into your smile
Even for a while I'd be with you, ooh

So what I always do
Is think about you
Think about you

Para bang baliw
Na tinatawag ka
Sa harap ng sinungaling

Na babalik ka pa giliw

May mga araw na parang kay bilis
Mga oras tila ba kay dali
Parang kulang di maintindihan
Ang sayang aking nararamdaman

Parang ibon ako'y lumilipad
At sa ulap ako ay napadpad
Yumayakap ang hanging kay lamig
Kay sarap naman ng pakiramdam

Gumagala
Ang puso't isipan
Hanggang langit
Na ang aking tuwa
Yan ang nadarama

People say that I'm a fool
Well I don't know
At least I found out
What it takes to be strong
I was dreaming all day long
A drifting cloud
With eyes wide open
I would choose not to see

Now I don't want
To see you anymore
Don't want to be the one
To play your game
Not even if you smile
Your sweetest smile
Not even if you beg me
Darling please

Say good morning to the world
I hope you like it

Take good care of all those
Things that we have
I've been looking for a way
For to long now
Seems like everything
Must come to an end

Now I don't want
To see you anymore
Don't want to be the one
To play your game
Not even if you smile
Your sweetest smile
Not even if you beg me

Time after time
Nothing that I can do
Knowing your ways
And loving your ways
But not getting through at all
Day after day
Leaving the past behind
Coming to terms
With stitches and burns and
Learning to fly again

Till I'm back where I belong

Baby I'll hurry down the chimney
While you're waiting by the fire side
Ready for all the love you give me
Cause I don't want another silent night

These lights don't shine so bright
Its snow falls all through these lights
But somehow this Christmas ain't the same without you
Cause I don't want another silent night

You're standing under that mistletoe
Dressed up and no place to go
And Santos tapping on your window but

All you do is play with my mind
Why you, why you
Wait for my que
When I don't ask for too much

I need more than just a late night
Candles lit under the moonlight
Why I always gotta say something
On your phone can never stay focused
Put your work in, gotta aim for it
Taking shots but are you game for this
Don't wanna force it

All that I need is those eyes oh
Only for me
Can you try more
Don't understand for the life of me
Won't you try for me
Don't give up, that's all I need

Didn't know it was a competition
Keeping score of all the dirty dishes
Could have been solved
With a conversation
Don't take much for ya
Show my love for you
Never enough
Why don't you trust, oh no

Say you need more then a late night
Might not always get the time right
Why you always gotta say something
Jumpin' high but still you stay frontin'
Put in work, you gotta aim for it
Taking shots, I got the game for this
I'm just tryna make this right

Got those eyes oh
Only for you
I can try more
Don't understand for the life of me
Don't see what I see
Don't give up, that's all I need

I've been waiting on you, baby
Never told me the rules it's been
All about you
If it's on me, it's on you too
Saying the same old thing
I've always been open
Baby, don't force it

Wag kang susuko mahal ko

Don't give up

All it takes is a smile
To make it all worth while

Drove down some broken roads
But we made in one piece
Old scars turn to memories
You were so patient with me
No, it doesn't get no better

You can warm all the cold
Turn a house to a home
There's no place that I'd rather be

I can bear all the storms
'Cause your light keeps me warm
No, I'm never alone

All it takes is a smile
To make it all worth while
When I'm lost and I've gone too far
You're my guiding

Stars are made to light the way
Made up of two hearts that never will stray
Even in the darkest moments
I'll know now which way to go
'Cause you'll always light up my soul

I can bear all the storms

Parang wala nang pagkakaunawaan
Walang pagbigayan sa panahong ito, ito, ito
Parang wala nang nagmamahalan
Wala nang ikaw, wala nang tayo

""Gusto ko,"" ""Kailangan ko"", ""Bigyan mo ko ng galang""
""Karapatan ko, inapakan mo"", ""Ayoko na sa'yo""
Wala nang usapan, para bang isang bula lang
Na mawawala na bigla ang lahat ng pangakong binitawan
Mas madali kasi bumitaw lang, pero

Sadyang mahirap iadya'ng
Pagmamahal na talagang tapat
P'wes, sino may sabi madali 'yan?
Bago ka sumuko, gawin mong lahat
Gawin mong lahat kahit ang bigat
Gawin mong lahat
Sapagkat kung hindi pa rin sapat
Malamang hindi mo pa nagawa

Laban, laban pa, laban, laban pa, laban, laban pa
Hangga't may hininga
Laban, laban pa, laban, laban pa, laban pa
Basta't para sa pagmamahal, dapat lumaban ka

Bakit wala kang hinahalagahan? (Bakit wala kang hinahalagahan?)
Sariling kapakinabangan lang ba ang talagang nais mo?
Puro sumbatan at pag-aalinlangan (Puro sumbatan, pag-aalinlangan)
Away at sigawan, abot sa ayawan
Ayaw mo kasing mahirapan, pero

Basta't para sa pagmamahal, dapat lumaban ka

Kahit ano pang nagawa
Kahit ilang beses pa, magpatawad ka
Tandaan mo na ang pag-ibig 'di lang salita
Patunayan mo 'yan sa lahat, sa kanila
Sa kanya't sa Kanya

Kahit ang dami dami na nagsasabi, ""Wag kang magpaka-martyr! Ano ka isang bayani?""
Wag kang mabahala, isang paalala:
'Di mo kailangan tularan mga masamang halimbawa na 'yan
Mabilis magsawa, kailan naging tama? Nakalimutan nila ata
Napawi sa alaala na para sa pag-ibig
Dapat handa kang magbigay

Alam kong mayro'n nang iba
Ang init ay nanlamig na
Ba't 'di maamin ang 'di malilihis?
Ikaw at ako'y tapos na

Bawat hakbang ay palayo ka
Walang linaw na babalik ka
Maagaw ka man ng iba sa akin
Pag-ibig ko'y patuloy pa rin

Ooh...

Sa lahat ng biglaang aking naranasan
Ito ang hinding-hindi ko pinagsisihan na mahulog agad sa 'yo

Alam kong tayo'y para sa isa't-isa
Sa akin, ikaw ay regalo n'ya
Sa 'yo, ako'y biyaya n'ya
Upang tayo'y lumigaya sa habang buhay
At tuluyang makalaya sa sakit ng nakaraan
Mahal kita

Kaya ikaw ang nais kong makapiling
Sa araw-araw kahit buhay ay simple
Basta't pareho tayong magtulungan
May mga panahong mag-aaway tayo
Pero please lang, 'wag kang aayaw
Please lang, 'wag kang bibitaw
Pangako sa iyo, sulit na ipaglaban natin 'to
Ako'y seryoso sa 'yo
Sigurado ako, hindi ako naglalaro
Tunay ang pag-ibig ko...

Ang mahulog sa 'yo'y ang pinaka-magandang nangyari sa akin

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Don't really care if it's right or wrong

As long as I take care of mine
The fam and the love of my life

No I can't sleep at night
Maybe the partying life or I'm working tonight
Got the target in sight
All of the money, the fashion, the flights

You know I've been working hard
And later I got a show
But I've been thinking 'bout you
Now, I don't want to go
If I come pick you up
We'll get around about four
Baby, close the door
Don't let 'em see what's going on

Lay back, take a sip
Hold your breath, let's take a dip
And just sink into the blue
Lay back, take a pick
Where do you want me to kiss?
Ain't nothing I'd rather do

In the afternoon
Not much that I wanna do except you
I think I'm way too in love with you
Can we just lay by the swimming pool now
'Cause I need to cool down (ooh ahh)
I need to cool down (ooh ahh)

Baby, it's getting hot
I think we should take it inside
After this liquor kicking in
I feel about right
I cancel my work today
Just for my princess
Put her on my checklist
It's time to get down to business

Lay back, take a sip

Blowin up my phone actin like you want me
Hear it in your tone that you're feelin sorry
Guilty and it shows, better watch your words
I don't wanna know, that'll make it worse

If you wanna talk, just say what I want, baby
Stay with me tonight, make it feel alright, baby
Drink, take a sip, when I picture you gone
And I don't wanna go down that road

Cuz I've been here too many times
So come and make my night
I know that it's not right
I just want you to

Lie to me
Promise that you'll handle my heart carefully
When you're walking away
Baby girl
Cry for me
Even if the tears that fall are make believe
I want you to lie to me
Oh, lie to me

La la lie to me, la la lie to me
Cry ah cry for me, cry ah cry for me

La la lie to me, la la lie to me
Cry ah cry for me, cry ah cry for me

I just want you to lie to me
Promise that you'll handle my heart carefully
When you're walking away
Baby girl
Cry for me
Even if the tears that fall are make believe
I want you to lie to me
Oh, lie to me

I guess forever was a game we were playing
I must have lost you at the finish line waiting
Used to love being on lockdown taken
Now I'm hearing something different what you saying
I know true love don't switch up like that
Even when it's hard love don't turn no backs
I know these horses need to run free
But baby running don't mean up and leaving me

So girl I wish you didn't have to go
Aw girl I wish you didn't have to leave
Baby stay one more night with me
Baby stay one more night with me
Aww baby stay just one more night with me please

Fairytales ain't meant to tell the truth
Cuz them kisses hardly working on you
See I thought I won a prize, I couldn't lose baby
But now you wanna pack it up and move so fast
If it's not me, I got another reason bad
Emergency, maybe we can fix what we had
Cause baby I just don't want to be a piece of your past

So I wish you didn't have to go
Aw girl I wish you didn't have to leave
Baby stay one more night with me
Baby stay one more night with me
Aw girl I wish you didn't have to go
Aw girl I wish you didn't have to leave
Baby stay one more night with me
Baby stay just one more night with me
Aww baby stay just one more night with me

So what's the reason, why you gotta go
Is it someone waiting for you back at home
Cuz every single second we alone
Oh girl I feel like I can't never let you go
I get on my knees to beg and beg and plead baby
See you digging deep, now you pulling out a ring crazy
You apologize for them dirty lies that you said to me baby

But you wish you didn't have to go
Aww yeah you wish you didn't have to leave
You would stay one more night with me
Yeah just stay one more night with me
Aw I wish you didn't have to go
Hey, I wish you didn't have to leave
You would stay one more night with me
Aww baby stay just one more night with me
Please baby stay one more night with me

Starting to think it wasn't all just me

That don't mean it don't matter

You were always there when the lights went out
I was there every time you were down
We got way too many scars and they come with doubt

What's life without a little fightin'
Girl what's love without a little bite

It was way too much and way too fast
I just needed space
And the world they built around our love
Wouldn't let us change

I swear I gave you my best
I know you gave me all of you
I know it hurts 'cause that shit hurt me too
I know you gave me your best
And I gave you all of me
I know it hurts 'cause that shit hurt you too
Oh, even all the greatest stories end
And I would do it all again
I know it hurts 'cause that shit hurt me too
It hurt me too

Used to be like diamonds and gold
Now we're like fire and smoke
I guess it's never easy letting go
It can be a lifetime tryna find the right one
But overnight we could say good bye

It was way too much and way too fast
I just needed space
And the world they built around our love
Wouldn't let us change

I swear I gave you my best
I know you gave me all of you
I know it hurts 'cause that shit hurt me too
I know you gave me your best
And I gave you all of me
I know it hurts 'cause that shit hurt you too

Oh, I remember
We were so in-love, yeah
Always running

I know you gave me your best
And I gave you all of me
I know it hurts 'cause that shit hurt me too

Oh, even all the greatest stories end
And I would do it all again

"""On The Wings Of Love""",James Reid,No Album,"

Just smile for me and let the day begin
You are the sunshine that lights my heart within
I'm sure that you're an angel in disguise
Come take my hand and together we will rise

On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high upon the wings of love

You look at me and I begin to melt
Just like the snow when a ray of sun is felt
I'm crazy 'bout you baby, can't you see?
I'd be so delighted if you would come with me

On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high upon the wings of love

Yes, you belong to me
And I'm yours exclusively
Right now we live and breathe each other
Inseparable it seems
We're flowing like a stream
Running free, traveling on the wings of love
On the wings of love

On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high upon the wings of love
Love
Of love

Oh I'm sorry, girl
For causing you much pain
Didn't mean to make you cry
Make your efforts all in vain
And I apologize
For all the things I've done
You were loving me so much
But all I did was let you down

Oh, I really don't
Know just what to say
All I know is that
I want you to stay... Yeah...

[Chorus:]
This time I'm not gonna let you slip away
This time I'm not gonna let another day go by
Without holding you so tight
Without treating you so right
This time I'm not gonna let go of your love
This time I promise you that we'll rise above it all
And I will never let you fall
I'm gonna give you my all
This time

Oh, I never thought
That I was hurting you
Now I know that I was wrong
Now I know just what to do

Gonna try to be
The best that I could be
All I need is one more chance
To make it up to you, you'll see

And there's one more thing
That you oughta know
All I know is that
I don't want you to go...

Gonna give you my all...

This feeling seems to grow more everyday
I love you more each day

I believe you
I believe in every word that you say
I love you all the way
Now I could swear
Love is not a game that children play
So tell me that you'll stay

Till I met you
I never knew what love was
Till I met you
This feeling seems to grow more everyday
I love you more each day

You and I should be together
Can't you see

I love you more each day

All I need today is my 3 in one
I delight with cappuccino

But I'd rather have my 3 in 1

But my favorite 3 in 1
Is the father and the son
And the holy spirit to guide me through
Believe that they are 3 in 1
They love you and everyone
They are equal and it's true
Oh my Lord, I believe in you

God the father's my creator
Jesus is my lord and savior
Holy spirit keeps me clean
Co'z I don't wanna live my life in sin

"""People Alone""",Jamie Rivera,No Album,"

Take me along
I don't care where you have gone
And I don't have to know
Exactly where you're going

If you leave me behind
Then everything on your mind
Will turn to pictures of the word
We might have been

People alone may go very fast
But maybe not so far
Playing along is still solitaire...
Remember
People alone may reach for a love
But only half as well
People alone may seem satisfied
How can they tell?

If we are crossing the line
Where there's no yours and no mine
We'll find it easy to see
People should be together

People alone may go very fast
But maybe not so far
Playing along is still solitaire...
Remember
People alone may reach for a love
But only half as well
People alone may seem satisfied
How can they tell?

Take me along
Let's not be people alone
I'm on your mind
So please don't leave me behind
Crossing the line
Where there's no yours and no mine

"""Purpose Driven Life""",Jamie Rivera,No Album,"

Many days have come and gone
Many years seem to have been wasted
Round and round like an aimless journey
Seems like weâve been here before
What on earth am I here for?

Come my friend, stop for a while
Life must be more than just existinâ
Round and round like a carousel ride
Shall we end where we began?
Tell me so Iâll understand

[Refrain:]
Let us begin to live this life
Let us together seek itâs purpose
Life is not a pointless venture
Eternity is for sure
Open up and receive this truth within your heart:
âThat God was smiling at your birth
And has a purpose for your lifeâ

Come my friend, stop for a while
Life must be more than just existinâ
Round and round like a carousel ride
Shall we end where we began?
Tell me so Iâll understand

[Refrain]

âI know the plans Iâve laid for you
Plans for goodness says the Lordâ
We were made to last forever
And heaven is our home

"""Reach One More For Jesus""",Jamie Rivera,No Album,"

As I looked in my father's eyes
Sat by his bed and held his hand
And I said my last good byes
He just held on for as long as he can
And I heard him say:

Reach one more for Jesus
Before I close my eyes
I must reach one more for Jesus
I won't let another day go by
That's what I'm living for
To reach one more, one more for Jesus

As I sat by father's side
I lay down my head upon his bed
And he felt the tears I cried
And he placed his hand upon my head
And I heard him say:

Reach one more for Jesus
Before you close your eyes
You must reach one more for Jesus
Don't let another day go by
That's what you're living for
To reach one more, one more for Jesus

Before he closed his eyes
For the final time
And left this earth for home
He said:

Reach one more for Jesus
Before we close our eyes
Gotta reach one more for Jesus
Don't let another day go by
That's what we're living for
To reach one more, reach one more for Jesus
That's what we're living for
To reach one more, one more for Jesus

Aanhin pa ang kayamanan

Lahat na nga ay kakamtin

Pagtalima, aking sumpa

Tangan kong kalooban
Sa iyo'y nilalaan
Dahil atas ng pagsuyo
Tumalima lamang sa 'yo

Nawa'y mabanaagan ka
Hinirang na tala ng umaga

Kahit alon man ng pangamba
Di alintana sapagkat naro'n ka

At kadiliman ng gabi

Tanglawan kami aming ina
Sa kalangitan naming pita

"""The Jubilee Song""",Jamie Rivera,No Album,"

It's a time of joy, a time of peace
A time when hearts are then set free
A time to heal the wounds of division
It's a time of grace, a time of hope
A time of sharing the gifts we have
A time to build the world that is one

It's the time to give thanks to the Father, Son and Spirit
And with Mary, our Mother, we sing this song
Open your hearts to the Lord and begin to see the mystery
That we are all together as one family
No more walls, no more chains, no more selfishness and closed doors
For we are in the fullness of God's time
It's the time of the Great Jubilee

It's a time of prayer, a time of praise
A time to lift our hands to God
A time to recall all our graces
It's a time to touch, time to reach
Those hearts that often wonder
A time to bring them back to God's embrace

It's the time to give thanks to the Father, Son and Spirit
And with Mary, our Mother, we sing this song
Open your hearts to the Lord and begin to see the mystery
That we are all together as one family
No more walls, no more chains, no more selfishness and closed doors
For we are in the fullness of God's time
It's the time of the Great Jubilee

Open your hearts to the Lord and begin to see the mystery

"""We Are All God's Children""",Jamie Rivera,No Album,"

Do you see these children on the streets
Have you walked the pavements where they sleep?
Do you feel their hands
When you give them alms?
Did you ever give them bread to eat?

Have you seen their homes washed by the floods?
While a mother tightly holds her child
Do you hear the wind
Of the raging storm?
Can you tell them where it's coming from?

Let us show our love and mercy
With true kindness and humility
For God loves the weak and the needy
Just like you and me

We are all God's children
We are all the same
He is calling us by name to help the poor and lame
And learn what life is really for
It's to know and love and serve the Lord

Stand together and let's do our part
Hear their voices mend their broken hearts
Choose to be brave fight for their rights
Give them back their honor and their pride

Please do not be blind and just leave them behind
To struggle in darkness or give them empty promises

We are all God's children
We are all the same
He is calling us by name to help the poor and lame
And learn what life is really for
It's to know and love and serve the Lord

It's to know and love and serve the Lord

"""Will Of The Wind""",Jamie Rivera,No Album,"

I've spent half my life
Looking for the reasons things must change
And half my life trying to make them stay the same
But love would fade like summer into fall
All that I could see was a mystery
It made no sense at all

The will of the wind, you feel it and then
It will pass you blowing steady
It comes and it goes and God only knows
You must keep your sails on ready
So when it begins, get all that you can
You must be friend, the will of the wind

I've spent so many hours
Thinking 'bout the way things might have been.
And so many hours trying to bring the good times back again
And so it goes for lonely hearted fools
They let their days slip away
Until they give into

The will of the wind, you feel it and then
It will pass you blowing steady
It comes and it goes and God only knows
You must keep your sails on ready
So when it begins, get all that you can
You must be friend, the will of the wind

So when it begins, get all that you can
You must be friend, the will of the wind

""Hey hey, be my fairytale""

It's been hard to admit but I'm falling apart
Catch every piece of me
And place me in your heart

Hard to admit but I'm falling apart
Catch every piece of me
And place me in your heart

I need a knight in shining armor to say
(I'll be your knight in shining armor to say)
Knight in shining armor
(Knight in shining armor)
Knight in shining armor to say

Be my fairytale, make this ship set sail
You're the real love I've been hoping for
Be my fairytale, I know this love won't fail
I'll be your knight in shining armor to say
""Hey, hey, be my fairytale""

Oh... Be my fairytale

Can you be my fairytale?
Can you make this ship set sail?
My mind is left in wonder
As I fix you in my gaze

Ako'y napapatigil
Hindi makaisip
Kapag naaalala ka
Mga letra at tono
Wala sa ayos
Pag ika'y nasisilayan
Hawak ang gitara, di makatugtog
Hawak mo ang puso, pusong nahulog
At ang iyong pagtawag, ng pangalan ko
Ang tanging naririnig
Umuulit nang ulit nang ulit lang

(At kahit na) maari pang magbago ang isip mo
(Wala na) wala ibang alam awitin itong puso ko
(Kahit na) bali-baliktarin man ang isip ko
(Wala nang) pinagninilayan kung 'di ang puso mo
At kung paano mabibihag 'to
Ako'y naba-blanko

Natutulala
Bawa't salita
May karugtong na paghahangad
Hawak ang gitara, di makatugtog

I like it, babe
When you look at me like
You can hardly bear to
Walk away
Come make me sing
That sweet melody like we
Did that day
Rollin' sheets
Playin' on real harmony
I like it, baby
Strum me back again
Pluck that rhythm
Shake me like nobody can

Do that thing
Start here on the low
Babe we gotta take it so slow
Do that thing
I gonna make you wanna
Keep the beat all night

Ride up
What's taking you so long
I can't wait for you to hear me on my head tone
Downtown is where the party's goin'
And I ain't gonna let nobody do me like you
Ride up
What's taking you so long
I can't wait for you to hear me on my head tone
Make me hit that head tone
I can't wait for you to do me like you do

Passion flowing, rushin' thru my veins
I'll be up all night
Isn't it insane
Singin' ladidadida
When we hit that high
And my heart goes wild
Make me scream, oh, like a child

In the shower, for hours and hours
You know this time is just ours
Baby, say my name
I know the rhythm and the flow
Imma put a little show
Oh, you be ready stayin' up
Once is not enough

Do that thing
Start here on the low
Babe we gotta take it so slow
Do that thing
I gonna make you wanna
Keep the beat all night

Ride up
What's taking you so long
I can't wait for you to hear me on my head tone

"""How Far I'll Go""",Janella Salvador,No Album,"

I've been staring at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I cannot go
Where I long to be

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

I know, everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know, everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go

"""Ikaw""",Janella Salvador,No Album,"

Sa pagpatak ng bawat oras ay ikaw

Ikaw ang pinangarap-ngarap ko
Simula ng matanto na balang araw iibig ang puso

Ikaw ang pag-ibig na hinintay
Puso ay nalumbay ng kay tagal
Ngunit ngayo'y nandito na
Ikaw, ikaw ang pag-ibig na binigay
Sa akin ng may kapal biyaya ka sa buhay ko
Ligaya't pag-ibig ko'y ikaw

Humihinto sa bawat oras ng tagpo
Ang pag-ikot ng mundo ngumingiti ng kusa aking puso
Pagka't nasagot na ang tanong
Nag-aalala noon kung may magmamahal sa'kin ng tunay

Ikaw ang pag-ibig na hinintay
Puso ay nalumbay ng kay tagal
Ngunit ngayo'y nandito na
Ikaw, ikaw ang pag-ibig na binigay
Sa akin ng may kapal biyaya ka sa buhay ko
Ligaya't pag-ibig ko'y ikaw

At hindi pa'ko umibig ng gan'to
At nasa isip makasama ka habang buhay

Ikaw ang pag-ibig na hinintay

"""Take It Easy""",Janella Salvador,No Album,"

Some people say bigger is better
But you wanna be smaller
Cause everybody thinks that its much better
Finding the right shade finding the right colors
You have to look good you have to look right You have to be like the others...

Going crazy on getting rid of that extra bump on your belly
Going hard for days staying hungry for other people's own definition of beauty...

Know that you're beautiful
You're no less than wonderful
You gotta know
You gotta go and just...

Take it easy... Ooh...
Don't compare yourself to
The girls on the magazines
Just be who you wanna be
Take it easy... Ooh...
Don't be blinded with
What the world wants you to be
Follow your heart and just take easy
And take it easy...

Your hips are constantly surrounded by tape With numbers...
Jumpin on the scale every day cause losing all the weight is all that matters...
Stop Wasting time trying to make your body
Like an hour glass...
Focus on the things in your life
That would forever last...

There's more to life than this
Show the world what you are made of
Taking all kinds of risk
Doing what you really love...

Know that you're beautiful
You're no less than wonderful
You gotta know
You gotta go and just...

Take it easy... Ooh...
Don't compare yourself to
The girls on the magazines
Just be who you wanna be

Its not a bad thing that you wanna be better
Don't lose yourself, just follow your heart and don't you waver
Don't let them put out the fire
That's burning inside you...
Don't let the world change you...
Don't let the world change you...

Take it easy... Ooh...

"""Wow Na Feelings""",Janella Salvador,No Album,"

Sana muli
Sana muling ika'y makasa â makasa â makasama ngayon
Walang balita sa iyo buhat noon
Magkaklase pa tayo nun
At nangyari
Reunion ng dating barkada naging buhay
Nang ika'y dumating grupo ay nag-ingay
Ikaw na lang ang hinihintay

At ngayon nandyan ka na
Di makatingin sa iyong mata
May'rong gumugulo sa'king nadarama
Pagkat may nililihim ako
At lumipas na ang ilang taon
Hindi pa ba ito ang tamang pagkakataon?

Hindi ko pa alam kung ipapadama
O hidden na lang tong wow na feelings
Na para sayoâ¦
Baka naman na mapahiya lang ako
Sa iyo'y mabigo pighati mabuo
Papano ba to?

Bakit muli
Bakit muling di na ma â di na ma â di na mapakali
Katabi kita't lalo ka pang lumalapit
Tensyon ay tumitindi
At nangyari
Tuksuhan ng ating barkadang pasaway
Walang pakialam at sila ay nag-ingay
Pwede bang magdikit kamay

At nang narinig kita tanong mo ay ""Ok ka ba?""
Hindi pa din masabi aking nadarama
Kasi nga ang lihim na ito'y
Tinatago ko hanggang ngayon
Hindi pa ba ito ang tamang pagkakataon?

Hindi ko pa alam kung ipapadama
O hidden na lang tong wow na feelings
Na para sayoâ¦
Baka naman na mapahiya lang ako
Sa iyo'y mabigo pighati mabuo
Papano ba to? Papano ba to?

Hindi ko pa alam kung nasan na ba ang lakas ng loob
Sana lang sana ay ibigay mo na to!!
Ohh Diyos ko naman
O kaya'y bahala na
Ayoko lang masayang 'tong wow na feelings

Baka mali
Baka mali sa inaaka â inaaka â akalang ito
Ating samahan siguro'y di magbabago
Heto't aaminin ko na nga sa iyo

Nang bigla mong inabot
Karton na may dalawang tiklop
Sa aking pagbuklat, ang nais ko ay naudlot
Nagulat sa natuklasan
Lugar at petsa't pangalan ng dalawang pusongâ¦
Tama na!!! Ikakasal ka na pala

Wohhhhhh!!!
Ohhhh!!!
Wow naman
Oh Diyos ko naman!
Di ko inaasahan
Ang sakit naman
Ang sakit sakit naman
Hindi ko nap ala ipapaalam at hidden na lang
Tong wow na feelings na para sayo
Na para sayoâ¦
Heto na nga't ako'y nabigo
Nawalan ng lakas ng loob
Pighati'y nabuo paano na 'to
Ohh paano na 'to
Siguro'y nararapat lamang ito
Dahil sa nagawa noon sa iyo
Sana'y di nagkaganito
Ohhhâ¦ pasensya na

Call my name and Iâll be there

Spending my days and nights just thinking of you
How you make me wanna smile
With the things that you do
When will I hear you say
Love is coming on your way
And that you start to feel the same
âCause every day, every night, I keep looking at the skies
And I pray that someday
You will wake up in my arms and love will never end
We belong together
Always and forever
Call my name and Iâll be there

âCause every day, every night, I keep looking at the skies
And Iâll pray that someday you will wake up in my arms

Astray and away

Wishing on a distant star
A glimpse of what we had
It is you I think about
Our memories of love

As time goes by
I found the reason why
Why Iâm falling deeper into you

When I close my eyes
Then I realize
With you I wanna be
And with open arms
Iâm waiting for the hour
For the time that you will see
See and feel the love
We deserve to have
You and I are meant to be
When I close my eyes
You are here with me

I canât help but cry
Dwellinâ on the past
Kisses in the night
That never falls apart

And all this time
I never stop to try
To bring back all thatâs left behind

When I close my eyes
Then I realize
With you I wanna be
And with open arms
Iâm waiting for the hour
For the time that you will see
See and feel the love
We deserve to have
You and I are meant to be
When I close my eyes
You are here with me

Itâs hard for me to face
The truth and not the lies
I beg you to believe
That I love you all my life

When I close my eyes
Then I realize
With you I wanna be
And with open arms
Iâm waiting for the hour
For the time that you will see
See and feel the love
We deserve to have
You and I are meant to be
When I close my eyes
You are here with me

When I close my eyes
You are hereâ¦ with me

Oh, I know, I watched you walk away
Everything we had was dead and gone

I've waited for so long, you know
That you're the only one I wanted
It's too late and I was wrong instead

I want to be back in your arms
I'll walk a thousand miles apart
Just to be right there, by your side
For you, I'll fight and catch a falling star
Wishin' I'm the one for you and you for me
Then suddenly it all just disappeared

My heart goes (My heart goes)
With you all along (With you all along)
Now I'm asking myself (Now I'm asking myself)

You promised me, you'll never leave me here

With written songs for you 
My hands shiver, this heart beating
This love might be true. 

So close, yet so distant
I donât know why never have I imagined, 
Iâd fall for you.

Let the dawn gather all our doubts 
That would infect this perfect heart 
For no reason than Iâm here 
I know of nothing more complete. 

Each day, my love grows deeper 
Deeper like never before
Love is not easy but Iâm holding on to this 
So donât give up 
And fill my heart 
Nothing else matters, 
But you and me. 

Weâre drifting apart 
My only greatest fear 
I thought I could live without you 
Shouldn't drown in tears. 
To you my all I surrender 
Iâve been waiting patiently 
Youâd never leave, 
You promised be my man, 
I love you freely.

Deeper like never before
Love is not easy but Iâm holding on to this 
So donât give up

Close your eyes and feel my love 
Take a breath, hold it dreaming

"""Tulad Mo""",Julie Anne San Jose,"""Deeper""","

Itong tula't kantang nais iparating,
Heto ang makatang bibo na malinis ang hangarin,
Pakinggan ang mga lirikong aking sasambitin,
Buhay ng batang nangangarap makamit ang mithiin,
Sa mundong ibabaw mga tao ay iba-iba,
Simula't sapul musmos na isip ay di alintana,
Ang biyayang binigay sakanya ng Panginoon,
Sa kanyang palad palagi mga dasal ay may tugon,
Tila ba sa bawat pag-awit nagmula sa puso,
Ngiti sa mga labi pagtapak ng entablado,
Mga taong binubulong sinisigaw kanyang pangalan,
Lubos ang ligaya sa musikang nilalaan ngunit sa kabila ng kanyang tinatahak na landas para bang may kapalit at magulo ang dinaranas,
Dating buhay, Ang simpleng pamumuhay,
Kung di lang sa pangarap na nabibigay na kulay...

[Chorus:]
Parang ihip lang ng hangin ang panahon,
Maraming tatahakin sa bawat yugto,
Tanong sa sarili kung titigil ba o tatakbo,
Tao lang naman ako na tulad mo...

Kay sarap isipin ang pangarap na tinatamasa parang panaginip
ang lahat ika'y sagana ngunit hindi kayang iwasa ang mapanghusgana para bang tuwang tuwa kapag ika'y nadarapa...
At minsan tinamaan nga naman ni Kupido,
Para bang nasa langit subalit naging komplikado,
Iniwang nakalutang at tuluyang nag-iisa,
Paulit-ulit ang tanong, Sino ba ang nagkasala...
Nagtiwala kasalanan bang damdamin ay tapat,
Yun ang akala ako pala'y hindi parin sapat,
Damang-dama, Mga sugat mahirap mawala hanggang sa pumatak nalang ang mga luha sa lupa,
Na tila ba, Nabubulagan, Bakas ang nakaraan,
Na di na dapat balikan sa laki ng kamalian,
Tuloy ang buhay at pangarap sa bawat segundo,
Tao lang naman ako at DAKILANG MACHO!...

You got me reelinâ, Iâm on the ceiling, uh uh
And I canât help it this love is what Iâm feelinâ
After ya leave thatâs when Iâm dreaminâ
âBout how happy we could be, but I get lost at seaâ¦

Itâs like a tidal wave, and it keeps on washing over
I try to fight it, but I still wanna hold yaâ
Tidal wave, and I just canât let it go (Nah)

I've been looking back
On everything, everything we had
Must have been out of my head
To say those things,
Say those things I said.

Now how do I go back
I know I can't.
Need a time machine
To rewind what I said.
It didn't sound right
It wasn't what I meant.
The way I felt it,
I want you to know that
I loved you and I did try
Wish we hadn't say goodbye
'Cause I love you forever and ever.

I just can't forget
The promises we walked away and left
Memories pulled me back,
They go 'round in,
They go 'round in my head.

Now how do I go back
I know I can't.
Need a time machine
To rewind what I said.

Can I tell you that I was only mad
I never should've turned away from a love like that.
And you... (kept on loving me)

The clock was ticking only to realize
That time was passing by
And so were memories running in my head
Oh running in my head
The nights turn into days but I wait here
Staring how those days turned gray
And everything was cold and dark
Oh baby so was your heart

In my mind
I forgot how love could change my heart
In my mind
I forgot how did we fall apart

So here I am standing on my own
I try to cry but see I have no one to lean on so
I recall, oh baby I recall
And here I ask why do I keep trying?
When I'm all alone with everything I'm facin'
So I recall, ohh baby I recall
When you were here
I recall when you were here

I try to throw away
The things that make me come back
To your sweet embrace
But every time that I say
The only thing that I could say

So here I am standing on my own
I try to cry but see I have no one to lean on so
I recall, oh baby I recall
And here I ask why do I keep trying?
When I'm all alone with everything I'm facin'
So I recall, ohh baby I recall
When you were here

I recall, I recall
The promises that we made for each other for each other

So here I am, why do I keep trying?
When I'm all alone with everything I'm facin'
So I recall, oh baby I recall
I recall When you were here

You're I've been looking for
I see you walking through my door
Day turns into night
And the night gets colder
Just as my hands are
Without yours to hold them
Breathing in for the first time
You have your ways and I have mine

I know very well
Right in between heaven and hell
We belong and you know I am here

When the sun goes down
And the moon rises
With our hearts on fire
In your arms I found
My way back home, hoo

Oooooh, baby I love you
Oooooh, baby I love you

How long have we waited
For these walls to crumble and fall
We both know how far
We've come to feel again
Swear I'll never let you go
I will always hold you close
Lay down your burdens
'Cause I am here

Oooooh, baby I love you
Oooooh, baby I love you
Oooooh, baby I love you

"""Life I Chose""",Julie Anne San Jose,No Album,"

Even though sometimes I feel like giving up 
I donât know why coz I still chose my life with you. 
Even if the rain would fall down soon enough 
Still donât know why 
Coz I chose to live my life with you.

Life with you is like magic 
And I feel blessed 
Though sometimes we tragic 
What had we missed 
Explains all the logic 
I donât treat relationships like a game of project 
Just so you know 
I can get emotional about it 
But I'm tryinâ to find solution 
So we could go about it 
This problem is soo person-al 
So crucial to the point that deep inside we dyinâ 
Hell nah 
That ainât soo me 
Why is it lonely 
You already had me 
Donât cha really know me 
We have enough time to adjust 
You and I is suppose to be build with trust and not lust 
So stressed out 
But yet 
We donât wanna get out 
Though itâs killinâ us softly everytime dwell out 
Donât want to end this like a lonely song 
But when itâs on 
Then itâs on 
Until we gone 
Thatâs soo wrong.

Even though sometimes I feel giving up 
I donât know why coz I still chose my life with you. 
Even if the rain would fall down soon enough 
Still donât know why 
Coz I chose to live my life with you.

Life I chose is the life that Iâve always been dreaminâ 
With you alone just completes the whole season 
How can I explain things without gettinâ mad 
After what we had that be soo sad 
Heart break get off my system 
Letâs try get back to how we started 
You know it 
The mutual attraction 
Observinâ every little move and every action 
See you laughân 
You know though 
That Iâll move mountains for you 
Seriously!I can be a fool for you 
Definitely! 
Not the choice but if you say so. 
No need to go away 
Would you stay with me here though 
Lookinâ for answers 
Arenât you sick of this 
Bypolar love searchinâ for the missinâ dove 
Naturally 
We rotate round love and hate 
Wait 
But for loves sake 
Letâs shape things up and have faith love.

Even though sometimes I feel like giving up 
I donât know why coz I still chose my life with you. 
Even if the rain would fall down soon enough 
Still donât know why 
Coz I chose to live my life with you.

Choose here, choose there 
Better play fair 
Do the walky talky to the atmosphere 
Treat me just right girl you know you ma queen 
Most beautiful thing that anybody had ever seen 
Donât ever look around seekinâ for them trouble 
Iâm right here and Iâll serve you on the double 
Look at the right sign 
Here baby if you mind 
You know you need me like I need you for a lifetime.

Even though sometimes I feel like giving up 
I donât know why coz I still chose my life with you. 
Even if the rain would fall down soon enough 
Still donât know why 
Coz I chose to live my life with you...[4x]

Darating ba

Wala na bang lungkot

Hahanapin ba

Pipiliin mo kaya ako
Kung piliin ko
Na maghintay
Na maghintay

Hindi panahon
Ang sagisag ng pag-ibig ko
Kundi pagkakataon
Na aking niyayapos at ayaw pakawalan
Ngunit ano'ng magagawa
Kung ako'y iwasan
Hahanapin ba
O pakakawalan na lang

Hindi titigil, hindi susuko
Hanggang kayo'y makita at minsan pang mayakap
Ang ligayang dati ay anong sarap
Muli tayong lahat

Kung alam niyo lang ako'y naliligaw
Kailangan ko kayo sa aking buhay
Kaya't magbalik na aking mga mahal

Of guy to win me over
And set my heart at ease

You've got to earn your stripes
Just like a soldier
If you wanna be with me

Then I met you
And you were making me feel
Something that's so unreal

And now I'm lost in my emotions
With the feeling of no fears
If it's a dream don't wake me up
I want it for eternity

You're the one I love
You're the one I love, I love
First it was nothing, 
Now I'm catching feelings
Something's over me
You captured my attention
And answered all my questions
Of what love is supposed to be
You're the one I love
You're the one I love, I love

Now that you know
What I'm feeling
I hope you feel the same way too

With a love so strong
It can never be wrong
And it was you all along

You inspire me at all, 
Everything I do
I want to hear those three words from you

Transcend our love
Greater than whatever
And right now I'm begging you
Please be mine

A day without you I feel so empty
Days seem so dark and blue
I look in your eyes
And I don't seem to have a clue

You're the one I love
You're the one I love, I love
First it was nothing, 
Now I'm catching feelings
Something's over me
You captured my attention
And answered all my questions
Of what love is supposed to be
You're the one I love
You're the one I love, I love

And when I'm in your arms
I'm infected by your charms
Ugh, you know it's killing me
It's taking control over me
You make it hard to breathe
And please make me relieved
You got me fallin' then you catch me
And you never leave
The words of love from my unspoken heart
Ugh, I'm losin' my mind
And I don't know where to start
I can't pretend there's nothing
Where there's something
This feeling can't be broken
Never letting go
And I just want you to know that... 

You're the one I love
You're the one I love, I love
First it was nothing, 
Now I'm catching feelings
Something's over me
You captured my attention
And answered all my questions
Of what love is supposed to be
You're the one I love
You're the one I love, I love

Never thought I'd see the day
The day love magically appears
'Cause some things are hard to believe in
Based on our fears

And I was scared
To love and then
You just popped up by surprise
And made me try to love again

Try love again
Try love again
Try love again
Let's try love again
Try love again

Let's try love again

No matter how I try to deny it
Love you just got to keep on trying so

Try love again

Let's try love again

Never thought I'd ever take
Another chance at love
But maybe this is kind of crazy
'Cause you're the one I've been thinking of

I don't understand how
How we got this far
Just set my world on fire
I loved it from the very start

Try love again
Try love again

Puso ko'y di mapigilan at ako'y natatamaan

Ginugulo mo ang aking isipan
Ako'y nabihag sa iyong kagandahan
Gusto ko ikaw ay akin lang
Ikaw ay akin lang

Gagawin ko lahat para sa'yo
Ikaw at ako 'di magbabago
Ako'y tatakbo papunta sa'yo
Kahit pa sa dulo ng mundo

Sa dulo ng sa dulo ng mundo (Woah oh oh oh)

I have to admit I am in the rough
Try to forget but it's just so tough, yeah
Hungry for peace and whenever I ease it
The more it just brings me down, no, no
But I still hang on

For if there's no pressure there'll be no diamonds
So I don't mind it comin' my way, no
I'm tired of putting out the fire
Freedom is all I desire
If there's no pressure there'll be no diamonds

I know I will be a diamond, diamond, diamond
I know I will be a diamond, diamond, a diamond, oh

People say they'll hear you
But they don't really understand
It's really so exhausting
They're tryna reach out for someone's hand
Keep on tellin' me it gets better
It's hard to see when all I get is bad weather, no
But I still hang on

If there's no pressure there'll be no diamonds
So I don't mind it comin' my way, no
I'm tired of putting out the fire
Freedom is all I desire
If there's no pressure there'll be no diamonds

I know I will be a diamond, diamond, diamond
I know I will be a diamond, diamond, a diamond, oh

Hunt for me, press on me
I don't mind seeing it comin' my way
Hunt for me, press on me
I don't mind seeing it comin' my way
Hunt for me, press on me
I don't mind seeing it comin' my way
Hunt for me, press on me
I don't mind seeing it comin' my way

If there's no pressure there'll be no diamonds
So I don't mind it comin' my way, no
I'm tired of putting out the fire
Freedom is all I desire
If there's no pressure there'll be no diamonds

I know I will be a diamond, diamond, diamond
I know I will be a diamond, diamond, a diamond, oh

"""Love Even If""",Jake Zyrus,"""Evolution""","

If hate begins with love
Why do we need to love?
If love's the answer
Why are there questions unanswered?

How can people become lovers
Then end up like strangers
You give your everything
Then end up with nothing
Nothing, oh nothing
Keep going
It's worth trying

Love even when it hurts
You just keep on loving
'Til it hurts no more
Love even when they don't
You just keep on loving
Til they love the way you do
Love, (love) even when it's difficult
You just keep on loving
Love, (love) til it becomes easy
You just keep on loving

Why we discriminate
Yet we say love wins and we celebrate
We say no prejudice
Yet we turn our blind eye with injustice

How can people become lovers
Then end up like strangers
You give your everything
Then end up with nothing
Nothing, oh nothing

Love even when it hurts
You just keep on loving
'Til it hurts no more
Love even when they don't
You just keep on loving
Til they love the way you do
Love, (love) even when it's difficult
You just keep on loving
Love, (love) til it becomes easy
You just keep on loving

Next time, we'll do it right
So that next time
We don't need the explanations 'cause when we
Keep secrets between us
Agree to disagree
Miscommunications, leave without apologies
They always say love hurts us most but also sets us free
For pain is temporary
All I'll do is

Love even when it hurts
You just keep on loving
'Til it hurts no more
Love even when they don't
You just keep on loving
Til they love the way you do
Love, (love) even when it's difficult
You just keep on loving
Love, (love) til it becomes easy
You just keep on loving

Looking at the coffee table
You'll see perfect pictures
If only they knew about us
Sure, we'll cook dinner together
We're never late in birthday parties
But tomorrow, it's the opposite

For we'll make bad decisions
We'll throw words that we'll regret
Prideful arguments
'Cause we know

It's not always easy
'Cause if we meet on the flipside
All we'll see are tangled threads
But if we meet on the other side
We'll see it all unknotted
Right now it looks like
We will never make sense
But once this tapestry is done
We'll see what love truly is
Once this tapestry is done
We'll believe what love truly is

Be together in every season
Laughing times without a reason
I never want this to end
But I know tomorrow
Everything will be different

For we'll make bad decisions
We'll throw words that we'll regret
Prideful arguments
'Cause we know

It's not always easy
'Cause if we meet on the flipside
All we'll see are tangled threads
But if we meet on the other side
We'll see it all unknotted
Right now it looks like
We will never make sense
But once this tapestry is done
We'll see what love truly is
Once this tapestry is done
We'll believe what love truly is
